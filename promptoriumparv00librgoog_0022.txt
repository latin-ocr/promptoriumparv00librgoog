ments to undertake a task which has now, aster many unforeseen impedi-
ments, been brought to completion. I will not, however, consume time in
seeking ιο propitiate those whose indulgence I might hope to win, for
shortcomings and imperfectione which no one perhaps can more truly esti—
mate or regret than myself. The student of early literature who has
engaged in the minute toils which such an undertaking demands, or in
the wearisome labor of collation, may be willing perhaps to regard with
leniency deficiencies and even inaccuracies into which the editor may have ’
men betrayed in the course of his work.

The special subjecte to which 1 have limited my observatione in the
following preliminary notices may be thus stated :—

1. The author of the Promptorium‚ with such traces as may be found
os his history or of his literary labore.

H. The sources from which his Latinity was derived.

III. The MSS. of the work, and also the printed editions which have been
available in the preparation of this volume.

I. We are enabled to ascertain with certainty, from the author's own

⁸ There was a chapel of St. catherine in the conventual chnrch, and with this chapel
probably the above-mentioned anchorago was connected. Heni-y le Doepencer, Bishop
of Norwich‚ wrote a letter ιο the mayor and burgesses of ann, 5 Rich. H. desii-ing
that they would grant their part of the house of St. Catherine to John Consulis, a servant
of Lord le Doepeneer, the bishop's brother, there to live a solitary life upon the alins
ol the good people; the other part of the house, belonging to the Archdeaoon of N orwich,
having been before granted to the said John Consolyf. Blomefield, {a supra, p. 613.
There was a remarkable hermitage at Lynn, in a cave on the sea-shore, in the bishop’s
marsh, at a spot called “ Lenne Crouch,'' where, as appears by a document dated 1349,
ι lofty brom, 110 feet in height, had been created ror the teuent or ”during men. But
