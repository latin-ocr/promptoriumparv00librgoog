of prestys‚” p. 413. The ‘⁶ Vite Patrum ”⁸ are given as the authority for
the Latin words occul-ring under “ Gyne, lytylle pot,” Ρ. 194. Reference
will be found to the ‘⁴ Horologium divine sapiencie ’² under “ Amuce of an
hare,” p. 11, probably the treatise with that title by the celebrated Domi·
nican preacher and ascetic divine of the fourteenth century, Henry de
Suson3 it was translated into anch and English, and was printed by
Caxton. Pits, however, ascribes ιο John wilton, a monk of Westminster,
c. 1360, a treatise entitled “ Horologium Sapientiae,'‘ commencing ‘⁴ Sen-
tite de Domin0.'’ The name of an author whom Ι have not succeeded in
identifying occurs under “ Cawdelle3 caldellum,’' p. 64, where it is said
‘⁴ hoc nomen habetur in commentario J ohannis de Gara.” Under “ Fecst3
emper? p. 158, are found the following, “Nota, de Agape in J ure, distinc-
tione xlij. Sa· quis ,- et Raymundus, lib. iii. tit. iv.'’ The former of these is
a reference to the first part of the Decretum of Gratian, of which several
printed editions exist3 the latter to the Summa by the Dominican Rai-
mundus de Pennaforte‚ compiler of the Decretals. Again, under another
word, “Frogge or froke, munkys abyte3 flocus, in Jure, libro vj.;” p. 179,
it is probable that we have a reference to the Decretals. References to
‘⁴ Greg’ in dialog.” deserve notice; the work in question being probably the
Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great, of which several early translations exist.
At p. 483 will be found “ Swerd berare3 spatarius, Greg’ in dialog.” and in
the winchester MS. “ Schyppe, boote3 carabus, secundum Greg’ x. dialog.”
1 may also here notice the following: “ Matyn at the chesse3 mato, ij.
libro de tribus dietis, cap. ij.;”¹’ and “Matynge at the chesse; mutacio,
·in libro iij. de dominis, cap. ij.;’‘ p. 239. Under “Leterone” we find a
Latin term for a lectern or desk, discus, given as “ secundum li. equi,” pos·
sibl y, as has been already suggested, the metrical vocabulary entitled “choe
Equus Gabellus? given by Mr. Wright among the Vocabularies published

⁸ The ‘⁸ De Vitis 88. Petrum liber ’⁹ has been attributed to St. Jerome, but heroon
the learned have been much at variance. Oudin, t. i. Ρ. 851. The work was doubtless,
a Bellarmine and others have obser-ved, compiled from several authors. 'l’heee lives
have been frequently printed; they were translated into several languagoe. A transsation
by Ceston from the French‚ fini-hed, ae the colophon stata cn the last day of his life,
was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. Dibdin, Typog. Ant. vol. ii. p. 43.

ὓ Er. W. S. Walford, to whose valuable suggestions 1 have very often been indebted,
has Ροίιιιοᾱ out that among the books of Obarles V. Κίος of Franco, 140⁹, occurs a
⁴⁸ Liber deti-ibus dietis,’' but there is no clue to what may have been the subject of it.
