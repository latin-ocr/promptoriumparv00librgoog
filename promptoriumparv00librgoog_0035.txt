some other writers affirm that he was an Englishman, who studied at
Oxford, and subsequently established himself in the University of Paris
early in the thirteenth century3 in 1229 he became a professor at Toulouse‚
but he returned to Paris, and probably died there soon aster 1250. He de-
dicated his treatise “ De mysteriis rerum que sunt in ecclesia,'’ of which
a notice will be foun'd hereafter, to Fulke Basset, Bishop of London 1241-
1259. Mr. Wright has entered more fully into the history of John de
Garlandia m the Introduction to his poem De triumphis Ecclesia edited for
the Roxburghe Club, and also m an introductory note in the edition of the
Dictionan‘ue above mentioned.⁸² He expresses the conclusion, to which I had
been likewise led to incline, that these treatises should be assigned to the
early part of the thirteenth century.

The author of the Promptorium has drawn so largely upon these obscure
relies of mediaeval learning that the vexed questions connected with John
de Garlandia, and the precise period when he wrote these grammatical
treatises once so highly esteemed, are not devoid of interest. Upon this
point of literary history, however, the evidence has been conclusively
summed up by the Rev. J. E. B. Mayor in a dissertation in the Journal of
Philology which 1 have already cited.¹’ Mr. Mayor observes that “ the
patriotic attempt of Dom Rivet (Hist. Litt. de la France‚ viii. 83) to esta-
blish the French descent of «Iohannes de Garlandia has been defeated by
the fail-nese os a later editor of that noble work, M. Victor le Clerc (azan.
xxi. 369), who has also proved that Johannes lived, not in the eleventh
century, as Geraud maintained as late as 1837, but amid the intellectual
stir os the thirteenth. For, in a poem entitled ‘ De Triumphis Ecclesiae‚’
portions of which have been printed by Mr. Wright,⁰ he thus at once
acknowledges and repudiates his native land . . .
