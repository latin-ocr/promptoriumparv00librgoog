ὓ This {abulous animal is particularly described by Sir John Maundevile‚ in hia account
of Bacharie. ‘⁴ In that eontree ben many griffounee, more plentee than in ony other
contree. Sum men seyn that thei han the body upward as an engle, and benethe as a
lyoune, and treuly thei seyu sothe that thei ben of that schapp. But o griffoun hathe the
body more gret, and is more strong thanne viij. lyouns, of suche lyouns ae ben o this half,
and more gret and strengel-e than an c. egles. suche as we han amonges us.'' He further
states that agriffin would bear to iu nest a horse, or a couple of oxen yoked to the plough;
its talona being like horna of great oxen, and serviug aa drinking·cups; and of the riba
and wing feathers strong bows were made. See p. 325. Caaley observes that in the
Cotton Library there was such a cup, 4 ft. in length, silver-hooped, and inscribed ‘⁸ Gripi&
unquis divo wicberto Dunelmensi sacer ,· '’ another curiously mounted as a standing cup,
on an eagle's leg of suver, is still preserved in the cabinet of antiquities at Paris, in the
King's Lim-ary, having been brought, at the Revolution, with the spoils of the treasury
of St. Denia. A curione account of it is given by Doublet, in his history of that abbey‚
p. 343. From an ancient MS. Invent. of the treaauxy of Bayeux cathedral, it appears
that three such talene were there preserved, and on solemn occasions appended to the
altar, aa precious rarities. A “ cortu de ynffoun ’' is mentioned in the Kalend. of Exeh.
iii. 176. The egg was likewise preserved as a valuable curiosity, and used as a gobletg
see the lists of the jewels and plato of Edw. 111. 1338, ibid. pp. 171, 172. ‘⁶ Itemj

Despenaer family, and the upper part appears as the erest on the belm of Hugh le
Despenaer, who died 1349. exhibited on his tomb at Tewkeabury. Another strikingly
designed representation of this curioua animal ia seen at Warwick, at the fest of Richard
Beauchamp, who died 1439.

³ R. Brunne uses this word in the sense of siem, or eruel. He says ot Rufus,

“To riche meu was he grillo, of pouer held no tales.'' Langton, chron. p. 92.

lt is thus used by chancer. See also Amis and Amiloun, 1275, 1802; Tovvueley Myst.

⁴ ‘⁸ A gripe‚ qriplm, malturfl cun. ane. This obsolete appellation of the vulture has
been derived trom Aug.-Sax. gripan, rapere. but more probably from the Lat. μην,
