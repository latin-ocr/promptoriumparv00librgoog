13. MS. in the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart. No· 8244,
formerly in Heber's library, No. 1020 3 imperfect, on paper. It contains
many English words3 the last word is ‘⁴ Vespilio.”

14. MS. in the same collection as the last. Ne. 8306. Bound up
with a transcript of the Promptorium described p. xl. supra. The two dic-
tionaries appear to have been written by the same hand. The Medulla
begins on p. 167. It is imperfect in several parte, and ends with ‘⁴ Tzct'o,
a brond of fyre,'' p. 342. On paper. From Heber’s library, No. 1360.

15. MS. in the Library of King Edward’s Grammar School at Shrews-
bury. “ Incipit liber intitulatus Medulla gramatice, ν’ Fructum gramatice
qu’ medullam de -breuitate.'’ The shelf mark is X. 29.

16. MS. in the library of the Earl of Leicester at Holkham, Norfolk.
It is cited by Sir Frederic Madden in his glossary to Havelok‚ edited by
him for the Roxburghe Club in 1828, as a Latin-English vocabulary of
the middle of the fifteenth century, and substantially the same as the
Ortus Vocabulorum.⁸ Chiefly on paper, partly on vellum. Its resemblance
to the Medulla appears by extracta, for which I am indebted to the Rev.
R. Collyer, Hon. Canon of Norwich. .

17. ln the enumeration ‘⁴ Librorum MSS. Henrici Worseley de Hos-
pitio Lincolniensi apud Londinium,'' c. 1697, occurs ‘⁴ Ne. 6914.66 3
Medulla Grammaticae sive Dictionarium Latino-Anglieum.'’ Catal. MSS.
Angliae‚ tom. ii. p. 213. I have not been able to trace where this copy

may now be preserved.¹’

11. Ortus Vocabulomm.-—The first Latin-English Dictionary printed in
this eountry; in great measure, as it would appear, based upon the Medulla

⁸ The name of ⁴⁸ Sire John Mendamew parson of ‘⁴ Bromenstrope ’' (Brunsthorp)
oecurring in this MS„ has been supposed to be that of the writer, but it is mere probably
the name of a for-ruer owner of the book. In the list of incumbente of Brunsthorp
John Mendham occurs. He was collated in 1529, and resigned the preferment in 1682.

b There existed formerly a MS. in the Chapter Librsry at Exeter cathedral, thus

noticed in the brief catalogue given in catal. MSS. Angliae, tom. ii. p. 55. “ 2057·3,
Dietionarium seu Glossarium Latinum, mutilum.'' This MS. which, from informationi
formerly received, 1 had hoped might prove to be a oopy of the Medulla, is not to be
round, as 1 am assured by Mr. charles Tueker, after careful search in the depositor-ies
of the Chapter. It is not mentioned in the short enumeration of MSS. st Exeter in

1752. See Dr. Oliver's Lives of the Bishops of Exeter, App. p. 376.
