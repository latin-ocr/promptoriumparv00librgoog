PREPAOE. XXV

Brito was, according to Pits, a native of Wales of ancient British race,
a monk of the Franciscan order versed in the learning of his times, and
his writings were highly in esteem in foreign lands: he died at Grimsby
in 1356.ει 11 does not appear that the Summa has been printed. Another
treatise entitled synonyma ascribed to Brito was, according to Fabricius,
prinffl at Paris in 1508. MSS. of the Summa are to be found in the
British Museum, Sloane MS. 3319 ; Add. MS. 10‚350‚ from Heber’s library3

see also Lambeth MS. 1903 MS. 0011. Ball. Oxou„ xi.; and MSS. Univ.
Libr. cantabr„ Catal. vol. iii„ p. 451.

4. Mirivalensis in Campo Florum—A large number of Latin words,

including many of obscure and curicus character,¹’ are cited as* derived
from this work, for which I have made diligent search hitherto in vain.

In the library of St. Peter’s College, Cambridge, there is a treatise thus
described3 “No. 1748, 86. Liber cui tit. Campusflorum. Pr. Fulcite me
floribus. Observat ordinem Alphabeticum.”⁰ This treatise, however,
consisting of short common-places from the fathers and canonists, has
proved on examination wholly different from the Campus Florum used in the
compilation of the Promptorium. I have failed equally in the endeavor
to identify the place or monastery stom which the name of the author
may have been taken. The Cistercian Abbey of Mereval (de Mira Valle)

⁶ It may be well to cite a few Latin words given on the authority of the Campus
Horum,- the following will be servioeable, ln any future inquii-y, for purposes of 00111-
parison, it any work thus entitled should be brought to light; it may have been known
by soine other title, sud hence my search has been fruitleoe. “ Appulmoce, dynehmet03

also because, as 1110 author states, 110 had compiled the work “ contemplacione venerabilis
