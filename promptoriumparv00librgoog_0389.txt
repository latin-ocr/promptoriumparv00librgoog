² Selden remarks that acquaintance with the Latin tongue was considered euch an
attainment that Latinium Latimztor, or Latinarum, became significant of an interpreter in
general. Hugo Latium-ius ie mentioned in Domeeday. Iatiuier, ae Roquefort explains
it, aignifled commonly an interpreter, truchement, or dragomen. He cites the Roman de
omn, where mention occure of a Lat-inter, whoee attainments extended to speaking
‘⁶ Roman, Enqlois, Galldis, et Breton‚ et Norman.'' Sir John Maundevsse, speaking of
the routes ιο the Holy Land, says of the one by way of Babylon, “ And alle weys syndon
men Latyheree to go with hem in the contreee and forthere be3onde, in to tyme that men
conne the langage.” Voiage, p. 71. In R. Ooer de Lion. 2473, 2491, Κ. Alis. 7089,
the words latymer‚ latimeris‚ ee printed by Weber, have the same sense.

⁸ Latten, a hard mixed metal much roeembling brana, was largely used in former times,
especially in the formation of sepulchral memoriale. The precise nature of ite composition
doee not appear to have been accurately ascertained. It ia repeatedly mentioned ae a
metal of a bright and golden colour ς Chaucer ueee the compariaon that Phoebus “ hewed
like latoun.'’ Gower speaks of it as distinct from bra-se, ae it seems properly to have been,
although occasionally consounded therewith‚ and even with copper. ‘⁴ Δαήοαίοπηι, i. fex
auri, laten or ooper.” eurus. “ Auricoelcum, Anqlice geldefome3 Elem-inum. latyne.’'
Harl. MS. 1002, f. 149. “Latyn metall, latn.” razso. Iaatten was probably obtained
{rom Germany. In the covenanta for the workmanehip of the effigy of Richard Bean-
champ, 1454, by Thoe. Stevyne, copper-smith of London‚ the metal ia described as
“latten‚” or ‘⁸ Cullen plate.'’ (Cologne Ρ) the valne of which was 10⁶1. a pound. The
remote derivation of the word is very obscure: it wne probably adopted in England from
the German Leston, or French laiton. Compare Dutch lattoen, Ial. laetum Ital. ottone,
latione, Span. daton, laton. Plate tin had aleo the appellation lat-ten. . See Forby and
Brockett, end the remarks of Nares and J amieeon.
