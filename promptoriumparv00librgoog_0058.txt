composed of the sun and stare, and the initials W 0 (William Oaxton) with
interlaced Arabio numerals 7 43 at the bottom are a greyhound, sagittariae,
and the name “ Wynkyn de Worde” on a scroll. On the reverse—“ Ἰ Incipit
prologus in libellum qui dicitur promptuarium.-Cernentibus solicite cleri-
corum,” &c- as in Pynson's edition before described, and also, a few various
readings excepted, in the MSS.; see p. 1, infra. On the second leaf,
sign. A. ij., commence ‘⁴ Nomina A.-·{ Incipit liber qui dicitur Promptua-
rium paruulorum siue clericorum.” On the last leaf, recto, we find, aster
tbe verbs commencing with Y, a note and two distiches relating to the
conjugatione of verbs, to which immediately succeed a notice “Ad lecto-

Besides the numerous editions by Wynkyn de Worde in small quarto the
Promptorium was printed in 1508 by Julian Notary in the same conveni-
ently portable form, suited for the requirements of studente. A single copy
is knowm itis preserved in the library of the late Right Hon. Thomas Gren-
ville‚ now in the British Museum.⁸' 1 cannot refrain from grateful aclmow-
ledgment of his liberal coustesy in entrusting to me this and also other
precious volumes‚ from which Ι have derived no slight advantage. This
edition is mentioned by Ames‚ but Mr- Grenville observed, adverting to the
volume in his own possession, “ 1 do not get trace of any other copy of it.’'
The volume consists of 73 leaves. The text appears to follow that given
by Wynkyn de Worde; the peges are printed in double columns, sign.

⁸ It may desei-ve mention that the verbe are mostly printed with the termination
yn or ους in a few metaneae, however, with a final e, as “agyns, usuc,- seyne, dicos
“⁸0thst &e- or ruse, as ‘⁴ psrgoayngo mnes, 9110205 pontivae, οι· Ροπηγου, pinno?
and not unfreqnently the peculiar form of the AaeSaxon gerundia} infinitivo, followed

in the MSS. 01 the Promptorium (see p. xlviii„ infra) is laid n1de3 for instance we find in
W. de Worde's edition ‘⁶ amende, bende bewes, consent,’' διο. The words written in the
MSS. with ῃ, and so printed by Pynson, are printed with y.

δ Tite dimensione of the leaves in thie copy are 7} inchoa by 52.
