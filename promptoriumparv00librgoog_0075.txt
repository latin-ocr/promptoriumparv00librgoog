Ortus in 1514, described p. lix. supra, we find these authorities combined

to which no allusion is made in the earlier editions, J odocus Ascensius‚
father-in-law of the eminent scholar and lexicographer Robert Stephens,
was a writer of considerable note at the period of the revival of learning.
It may not easily be ascertained from which of his treatises these perpulerat

in the preparation of the OrtuS, the earliest work of its class printed in
England, the most erudite authorities available at the period had been

The following enumeration of editions of the Ortus Vocabulorum may
be acceptable in desault of accurate notices of the work by bibliographical
writers.

⁸ An account of the liter-ry labore of mensim is given by Mainake, vit. Stepha-
norum, pp. 17, 109. His untione ‘⁶ De Epistolis'' and ‘⁴ De orthographia latinorum
dictionum ” were included in a collection published in 1601, to which he prefixed a pre-
face “ ex officina nostra litteraria in Pari-his. Lutetia.'' Another of his works, the ‘⁴ Voca-
