declared at the commencement :—“ Liber iste vocatur femina quia sicut
femina docet infantem loqui maternam sic docet iste liber juvenes retho-
rice loqui gallicum.’' The concluding chapter, ‘⁴ De moribus infantis,‘’
gives admonitions for discreet behaviour in the various relations of social
life, citing the favorite moral treatise by Magnus Cato, the Proverbs of
Solomon, and the like, and ending as follows :—
“ ἹῘ Ore priez dieu issint puissetez finer,

Qe a soun joye purrez vener.

Now prayeth God so 3e may end,

That to hys joye 3e may kome, so be hyt. Amen.’'

Then follows a “ kalender ” or alphabetical table of words in three
columns, “linia scripcioniS,” the word written according to the orthography
of the period3 “ Regula locucionis,” the proper pronunciation3 “ Regula
construccionis,” the English rendering of the word. For instance, “ Ohien
secundum pikardiam, Chaan secundm parisium,‘’ as written under the
first head, is to be pronounced “ cheen vel chaun, an hounde ;” and
‘⁴ Chiet secundum pikardiam, Chiat secundum parisium,” has the pronun-
ciation “ cheet vel chaat, an kat.” This curious table ends with the aspi-
ratiou ‘⁸ Qui scripsit carmen sit benedictus. mem—Explicit Femina

Ι leam, with great regret, from the librarian, Mr. Aldis Wright‚ that this
precious volume, which was restored by me in Feb. 1844, is no longer to
be found amongst the MSS. at Trinity Gollege. It is fortunate that some
portione should have been preserved by Hickes‚ although insufficient to
make amends to the philologist for so untoward a loss.¹’

creaturarum Β. 14, 403 the Life of St. Margaret in very old English verae3 Liber
