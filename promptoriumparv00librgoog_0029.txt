or Grammaticea. The noticee of the recluae of Lynn, to whom we are un·
doubtedly indebted for the Promptorium‚ would be incomplete without
come account of the Medulla, and of auch MSS. of that valuable compila-
tion aa I have been enabled to discover. The two works have been ascribed,
with much probability, to the same author. I have, however, failed to
discover any contemporary statement ιο that effect3 the name of Galfridus,
it is true, ia found aa that of the author in several MSS. of the Latin·
English dictionary in question, but such enti-ies are, I believe, by a later
hand. Thia ascription may be solely on the authority of Bale, who gina, aa
before cited, among the writinge of Galfridus GrammaticuS, the following :—

“ Hortum Vocabulorum, lib. i. Ut etenim multos (noatroe proe.

“Medullam Grammatices‚ lib. i. Ger-uentibus solicite clericorum.”

The Proloyua of the Latin-English dictionum, the ortua, printed by
Wynkyn de Worde in 1500, begins ‘⁴ Ut etenim multos‚’' dcc. Ι have never
found this preface in any MS. ς Gie only prologue occur-ring in MSS. here-

after described of the dictionary entitled Medulla, of which 1 believe the ,·

Ortus to be a modified reproduction, begine ‘⁴ Hec est regula hujus libri.”
See noticee of these MSS„ p. l. ιο liv. infra.

The second work attributed by Biahop Bale to Galffidus, under the
title of Medulla GrammaticeS, seems to have been in fact the English·
Latin dictionary or prompta-ium, the prologue of which begins alike in
the MSS. and in the printed copies with the phrase given by Bale-—“ Cer-
nentibua solicite clericorum? But in the colophon of Pynaon'a edition of
1499 we find—“pinu excellentissimum opus, dcc. quod nuncupatur Me-
dulla Grammatice.‘’ See p. 539 infra. In Wynkyn de Worde’e edition the
corresponding phrase is—“ opus quod merito Medulla Grammatice apud
noa, vel Paruulorum Promptuarium nuncupatur.” Hence doubtlesS, has
arinen some discrepancy which it is desirable to point out, since Pits and
the learned Biehop Tanner have followed Bale in ascribing to our author one
dictionary (English—Latin) under a title which properly belongs to another.⁸

The MSS. of the Medulla are more numerous than those os the Prompto-

⁸ It deaervea notice that these authorities agree in ωσι-ἰδίῃς the authorsbip ot the
‘⁸ Hortua Vocabulorum '' ιο θειΙίτίᾶιιι Grammaticus, and it will be remembered that Bale
strat publiahed hia account in 1548, abouta century ponibly aiter the recluae at Lynn
brought hia labora to completiou. There can be little doubt that they contributed
largely to that book, although hia original compilation may have been amended and
