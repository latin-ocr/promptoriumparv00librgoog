(3,) “ catholicon in Lingua materna.”—The valuable English-Latin
Dictionary‚ frequently cited iu the notes to this edition of the Promptu-
rium as the “ catholicon Anglicum,” is a MS. which was kindly confided
to me in 1841 by Lord Monson, as before stated? Its contente are
wholly distinct from those of the Promptorium3 the nouns, verbs, and
other parts of speech are arranged consecutively in alphabetical order,
instead of forming, as in the Promptorium‚ a Nominale and a Ver-bale.
The MS. consists of 16 ‘⁴ quaterni,” or 192 leaves3 dimensione Siinches
by 6. At the end of the Dictionary, which forms 183 leaves, are the fol-
lowing note and colophon:

‘⁴ Nota.— Quum ad utilitatem et comodum singulorum, in grammatica
precipue proficere cnpiencium, hanc brevem et summariam tabulam
extractam de tabula prescripta Catholicon breviter nuncupatur in linguam
maternam, Deo disponente, disposui, sic jam proferre respicienti seu
studenti, supplicans siqua in ea reprehensione digna invenerit, aut corrigat,
aut oculis clausis pertranseat, aut saltem humane ignorancie imputet.
Ἴ Sed inquirendo quisque prudenter caveat, tum cle variacione linguarum

⁸ See Advertisement, p. x. Ι recall with pleusure that my attention was directed to this
remarkable MS. by a valued friend at Lincolu, the late Mr. E. J. Willson, by whom it
had been cited as explanatory osa few architectural terma.
