² Liaeinum, us. end s. Uguitio gives lima, aqua, whenee‘ ‘liaeinmm quia eit ex aqua
et cinere.” Arund MS. 508. The early romances and Chaucer' s poems »ἔοι-(1 evidence
that yenow or light-coloured hair wns in especial esteem. The fashion prevailed nt e
very early period, ns appears from the writings οι· Tertullum, who reproaches Christian
women with nn effeetetion of secking to resemble in this respect those of Germany and
Gaul. The nrt of producing this colour nrtifloiauy was termed crocupkantea, end is
condemned by St. Cyprium and St. Jerome nsasinful vanitq, and by Galen es preju-
dicipl to henlth. At the time when the Promptorium was compiled this Inshion con·
tinued in tun force, end numerous artifloial expediente had been devised lor supplying
the defect of nature, by means of some vegetshle decoction or lie, whereby, with snb-
sequent exposure ιο the sun, the hair might be made ιο assume the desired colour. The
herbnls and medicinnl trectises or the XVth cent. indicate a. great variety of processes
which were adopted for colouring or preeerving the heir. In Arundel MS. 42,f. 82,
the doeoction οἰ ιιιειᾱᾱοι· is recommended ιο make it red, end the Juice of nge applied
in the hot sun ιο make it blaekg f. 77, b. The virtues of the lily sre commended for
makinghsir to grew again, and the cil of hezel nuts as infauible against“ mowtynge
of here,” f. 593 and an effectus! depilatory“ for· doyng here’' is given ιιι ι’. 35. The
strengest snbstsnces were in request for such pul-poses- thus in Jul. D. vm. f. 79, b.

“lixivium de cinere fimi columbi'' is recommended aa an approved remedy against
the falling of hair. The extent ιο which such artificisl nids were made available at e
later period appears from the number-less prescriptione given by Get-arde, Perkiuson‚
ungium, in his Garden ot Health‚ 1579, end similar writers. See the satirica! ob-
servatione of Bulwer on this subject, in the Artificial Changling, 1653. Hermen, who
wrote nt the commencement of the reign of Hen. vm. says that “meydene were
sylken callis, with the whiche they keepe in ordre theyr heare made yelowe with 1503
comas lixivio Qffatas eive ηιιιιὶαειω. Women chaunge the naturali colour of theyr
heere with crafty eolour end sonnyng. Some cherieshe theyr busshis oi* heare with moehe
kymbeyuge and wesshynge in lye. He maketh his heare yelowe bycause he wolde seme
lustye; mitat capillos ιιι veyetm appareat. His heare wan lyght ambre.'' Vulgus-ic,
1519. To such practices allusion is perhaps made in the Promptorium by the word naen
wmcaruon, which will be found above, p. 232. “ Lee, lixivium, locinw· cun. Anto.
