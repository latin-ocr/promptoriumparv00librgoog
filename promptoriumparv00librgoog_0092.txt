(32 ) Glossarial Collections by Bishop Kennett.—The Glossary ¹appended
by the learned Bishop of Peterborough to 1115 “ Paroehial Antiquities,’' of
which the first edition appeared in 1695, is highly to be appreciated. 1
would invite attention to 1115 valuable collection of obsolete and provincial
expressions preserved in the British Museum, in Lansdowne MS. 1033,
which Ι have cited frequently in the following pages. This large compila-
tion is wholly distinct from 'the printed Glossary, and seems well deserving
of publication3 independently of the value of the etymological sugges-
tions, there can be little doubt that numerous dialectic words are here to
be found, which have subsequently been wholly disused and forgotten.⁸

(33.) Glossary of Archaic and Provincial words, by the late Rev.
Jonathan Boucher, Vicar of Epsom.—A portion of this work, containing
the letter A, was printed aster the death of the author in 1804 by Sir F.
Morton Eden3 Lond. 1807, 4120. It was entitled ‘⁴ A Supplement to Dr.
Johnson's Dictionary, or a Glossary of Obsolete and Provincial Words.”
In 1832 another edition commenced under the editorial care of the late
Mr. Hunter, author of the Hallamshire Glossary‚ and os Mr. J oseph Ste-
venson. 'I'wo parts were published in 4t0. containing Boucher’s Introduc-
tory Essay, with the Glossary as far as the word ‘⁶ Blade.’' Mr. Boucher’s
MSS. remained in Mr. Hunter's hands; at the dispersion of his library,
after his death in 1861, these Glossarial collectione were purchased by Mr.
Russell Smith, and sold by him to Mr. Halliwell; they were again sold at

Messrs. Sotheby’s in 1864, and came into the possession, as I believe, of
Mr. C. E. Hodgkin‚ West Derby, Lancashire.

(34.) ‘⁴ Glossary of words, Phrases, dac. in the works of English au-
thors, particularly Shakespeare and 1115 contemporaries ;” by Archdeaeon
N ares.—This valuable work, which I have osten cited as explaining ar-
chaisms of an quier period than that set forth in the title, is replete with
curicus illustrations of early language and literature. It was first pub-
lished in 1822, Lond. 4t0.; a second edition, considerably augmented, was

⁸ The Bishop died in 1728; these collections were probably compiled towards the
close of the previous century, and not long after the earliest printed notice of local words,

namely that published by Ray as early as 16⁷4, but brief and meagre 55 compared with
the MS. Glossary above cited.
