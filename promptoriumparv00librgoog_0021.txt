PREFAOE.

ΟΝ the completion of a long-promised contribution to English lexicography
some introductory notices seem indispensible, as an accompaniment to one
of the most valuable linguistic monuments of its class to be found in any
European country. Whether we regard the Promptorium Parvulorum ⁸
as an authentic record of the English language in the earlier half of the
fisteenth century, as illustrative of the provincial dialects of East Anglia,
or as explanatory of the numerous archaisms of a debased Latinity that
per-vades early chronicles and documents, its value can scarcely be too
highly estimated. If, on the other hand, we take into consideration the
curious evidence which it supplies to those who investigate the arts and
manners of bygone times, it were difficult to point out any relic of learning
at the period equally full of instruction, and of those suggestive details
which claim the attention of studente of mediaeval literature and antiquities
in the varied departments of archaeological research.

These considerations, not less than the great scarcity of the work,

- whether we enumerate the MSS. hereafter described, 01· the few and often

mutilated copies of editions by the fathers of English typography, Pynson,
Julian Notary, and Wynkyn de Worde, preserved to our days, were induce-

· In the MS. at King's College, Cambridge, the work is entitled, in the prologue,
‘⁴ Promptorius Parvulorum;” in Pynson's edition “ Promptorius Puerorum ;” and in
that by Wynkyn de Worde “Promptuarinm Parvulorum Clericorum.'' The last title
is doubtless most correct. Promptum-ium in classica} latinity signifles a storo-roem or
repetitor-53 in mediaeval times it denoted the department in a conventual or collegiate
establishment or the like, whence stores were dispensed, which in a monastery was
under the charge of the Cellas-er. The author gives “ Boterye; celarium, promptuarium;‘’
p. 453 ‘⁴ Celet-3 promptuarium ς Celei-ere of the howse; cellerarius, promptuarius;” p. 65;
“ Sperne, botei-y or eelere3 cellarium, promptuarium 3⁹⁹ p. 468. Aa illustratione of the
nso ot the term by medioeval writers, 1 may mention the ‘⁸ Promptum-ium argumentorum
dialogice ordinatorum,” Colon. 1496, '‘ Promptuarium exemplorum,” appended to the
“ Sermones de Sanctis '' printed by Julian Notary in 1510, “ J oh. Herolt Promptum-ium,”
Nur-emb. 1520, and “Jo. Piniciaui Promptum-ium Vocabulorum3'’ Aug. Vind. 1516.
The title, it may be observed, was adopted for a Latin-French and Frenoh-Latin vocabu-
lary, “Promptum-ium Latina Lingnae,” printed at Antwerp by Plautia. 15643 and the

 

well-known series of medauion porti-aits first published at Lyons in 1553 is entitled ⁸

‘⁴ Promptuarium leonum Insigniorum.''
