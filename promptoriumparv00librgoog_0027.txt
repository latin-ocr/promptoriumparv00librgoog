PREFAbE. xix

‘ Cernentibus solicite clericorum! Lond. 1499, fol. MS. eccl. Lincoln.
H ..... Quod sequuntur N ominale‚ Vcrbale, in cuj us margine scribitur

The identity of the name Galfridus will, 1 think, scarcely dispose us to
accept the suggestion of the Bishop of St. Asaph as regards the marginal
scribbling which he noticed in this Lincoln Ms.; the name Starkey, not
unknown in East Anglia, is more probably to be regarded as that of a
former possessor of the volume than that of the author. whatever may have
been his patronymic, 1 think that we may confidently ascribe to the Domi-
nican recluse of Lynn, G-affridus, designated, from his special studies in an
age of very debased learning, “ Grammaticus,’‘ the laborious achievement
of the first English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionaries. No doubt can,
1 think, be entertained of his identity with the expounder of the ‘⁴ Equi-
voca'‘ and the “ Synonyma ’² of John de Garlandia, who is entitled ‘⁴ Ma-
gister Galfridus Anglicus ’⁹ in the editions of those popular treatises printed
by Pynson and W. de Worde.

The author describes with simple earnestness in his Preambulum the
troubles of aspir-ing scholare, who, amidst the prevalent barbarism of his
times, thirsted for knowledge like harts for the water-brooks‚ and in vain
sought for guides, so that like wild asses they fainted in sobbing and sighs;
according to the lament of the prophet, the young children ask bread, and
no man breaketh it unto them l He “drew up for their use,” as expressed
by the Rev. J. E. Β. Mayor, in his valuable Essays on early Lexicography‚
“ a slight compendium, ‘ opus exile,’ chiefly from the Catholicon, Campus
Florum, and Diccionarium. The most ignorant calumniator of the middle
ages could not speak of the poor recluse (‘ sub regula paupertatis astric-

⁸ Bibl. Bria-His. p. 306. The description of the Lincoln MS. given by the learned
bishcp would lead us to conclude that it was a copy of the Promptcrium, munch, an
English-Latin Dictionary. It is probable that Tanner had formed such a supposition
bom the circumstance that in the colophon of Pynson’s edition ot the Promptorium that
work is entitled ‘⁴ Medulla Grammatice'’ (see p. 539, infra), properly the designation of
the Latin-English Dictionary compiled possibly by the same author. The MS. noticed by
Tanner is still in the libr-ary, as before stated (see p. xvii„ note e); it is in fact a Latin-
English Dicticnary3 at the end is written ‘⁴ Explicit Medulla Grammatice.'' The volume

contains also a ‘⁴ Verbale,'' and the ‘⁴ Liber Hymnorum cum expositione Gale-idi '⁴' men-
tioned by Tanner.
