the peninsula, or accumulation of alluvial deponit formed at a eonfluence of wetere. lt
is, however, remarkable that the name does not appear to be thus applied on the Norfolk
const, especially in the neighbourhood ol Lynn, where the Promptbrium was compiled,
and where such deponite are made to a vast extent by the Ouoe, and other summe that
flow into the Wash.
