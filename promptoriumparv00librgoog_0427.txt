² The martyroloyium was, in the earlier times, the register of names of saints and
mat-tyrs, which served to bring each successively to the memory of the faithful, on the
anniversary of his Passion. At a later period the term denoted, in monastic establish-
ments especially, the regist-er more properly called necroloyium, or obituary, wherein
were inscribed the obite and benefactione of those who had been received into the fra-
ternity of the congregation, and whose names were thus in due course brought to mind,
being recited day by day in the chapter, and suitable prayers said. The martyrolog!
was termed also uber vitae, and the memorial inscribed annotatio Requloe, because it was
generally annexed to the Rule, and connected therewith was the obstuary, wherein the
deaths of abbots, priore, and members of the congregation in general, were recorded.
The martyr-aloytum occurs next to the requla canonicorum, among the gifts of Bp.
Leosric to Exeter, in 1050. The nature of the entries made may be seen by Leland's
“ thingges excerptid out of the martyrologe booke at Saresbyri,” aud at Hereford.

⁸ The mai-tinet or martlet is the Hir-undo urbica, Linn. and both appellatione appear
ιο have been taken from the French. Skinner considers it to be a diminutive of the

roper name, comparing the usage of calling a parrot or a starling Richard, or a ram

bert, and rejects as fanciful the conjecture os Minsheu that the name martinet was

given in allusion to its arrival at the end of March, and migration before St. Martin’a
