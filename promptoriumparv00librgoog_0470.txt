earliest introduction of clocks, Archoeol. v. 416, but could find no instance of an horo·
leffium. which, being described as striking the hours. was undeniably a cloch, and not
a dial, previously to the construction of the remarkable clock near westminster Hall,
supplied out of a fine imposed on Rad. de Hengham‚ chief justice of the King’s Bench,
1288. But there can be little question that clocks vvere in use at ιιι earlier period. It
may be doubted whether the ⁸⁴ Orelooium iurique ’' given by William the Sacrist to
Sherborn‚ in the XIIth cent„ vvere of this nature (Sherborn Cartulsry‚ in the possession
of Sir Thos. Phsslipps); and the korotoqium, or alarum. the fall os which before the
hour of matins gave the alsi-m of the conflagration of the chnrch of Bury, in 1198, as
described by J ocelin de Brakelondm p. 78, appears by the context to have been ι kind of
clepsydra. Numerone notices might be collected regarding the orloges of a later time,
such as thatin Canterbury Cathedral‚ which cost 230, in 1292 ; and the celebrated
one given to the Church of St. Alban's in 1326, by Abbot Ric. de wallingford, which,
as it is stated, Cott. MS. Nero, D. vn. f. 196, sui-passed any other in England‚ or even
in Europe, according to Leland, Script. Brit. ii. 401. Α remarkable clock still exista at
Exeter‚ generally regarded as the gift of Bp. courtenay, who was consecrated 1478, but
it is highly probable that it is the same koroloyium which is named in Pet. 11 Edw. 11.
1317. Frequent mention occurs of ⁴· koroloyii Regis infra palatium Westm’‚'' as in
Pat. 1 Hen. V. in favour of the keeper. Hen. Berton, “ valet-tus camere Reqis.·” and
in the Acts of Privy Council. especially in 6 Hen. vl. 1428, vol. iii. 288, where sc·
counts of repairs done to the ‘⁸ orelege ” may be found, which supply curicus terms of
the craft. Amongst the valuable effecta of Hen. V. ennmerated 1423, was ‘⁴ j. orlage,

Fabyan relates, on the authority οἱ Gagnin‚ that amongst the presente sent A.D. 807 to
Charlemagne by the King of Persia ‘⁸ was an horologe of a clocke of laten of a wonder
artyfycyall makyng, that at euery oure of the daye and nyghte, when the sayd cloeke
shuld stryke, images on horse baclte apperyd out of sondry places, and aftir departid

to allude when he says, f. 231, v0, ⁴⁸ Some for ι tryfull pley the deuyll in the orlege;

Martene. Coll. Ampl. V. 960, and Eginh. Ann. Fr. that Charlemagne’s “ horologe”
was a clepsydra. Abp. Pau-ker devised in 1575, to the Bp. of Ely, “baculum meum de
canna Indica, qui horoloyium habet in summitate.'’ See Professor Hamberger’s curious
dissertation on clocks in Becltman's nist. of Inventions.
