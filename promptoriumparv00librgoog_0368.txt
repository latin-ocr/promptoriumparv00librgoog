¹ Dicta, according to the catholicon, significa a day'e Journey: the term occure in thie
aenae in Bracton and Fleta, where it ie said that “ omnis rationabilis dieta constat ex xx.
miliar-anuss’ Chaucer uses the word in this sense, Knight's Τ. 2,74Ο; chancer-’e Dream,
1945; and also in that of a day'e work, Rom. of Reae, 579. Journey had also the
signification of a day'e confliet, in like manner as the expression ‘⁶ the day ’⁹ ia used at
present. Thus in the Paston Lettera it ia said of the Battle of St. Albam, 1455, that
“alle the Lot-dee that dyed at the jorney arn beryed at Seynt Albanea; ” and the en-
gagement is tei-med ‘⁸ the male journey ” of St. Albnn's‚ meaning, apparently, the disac-
troue battle. Vol. i. 108, 110. See Jamieson, v. Jorneye. In Norfolk, Journey implico
the time a man ia at plough, about six honre ς if he werke nine, two J ourneys are taken.

² In the catholicon murt-o ie rendered murmurator, and mun-ium, murmur, lateus
locutio. Both the English and Latin words are here evidently onomatopeiae, and in like
manner the eound produced by different birds ie tei-med jur-ring, οι· jan-ing. In the
Liber vocatus Femina, MS. Trin. 0011. Cant.. amonget the noises of animale, it is said
that ‘⁰ Celare ier-ist, et cole elizeum, coluere iul-rut, and col-1 syngeb.'' 'l'o jurre significa
also to atrike harshly against any thing, in which sense it ie used by Helland, Pliny,
B. lx. 802 Livy, p. 963. Cotgrave gives “Boe-qm. to butte or jurre. Hem-ter, to
knock, puch. jur, joun, or hit violently against.” Jamieson gives jnrr aa signifying the
noiee οἵ water falling among looee stenes.

³ J anselle wan a compound of egge and grated broad, with eaffron and uage, boiled in
broth. The name seems to have been taken from the ancient dish called Juscellum by
