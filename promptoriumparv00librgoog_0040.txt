(i. equus) blattaque (i. purpura) supinus (i. superbus)·.⁸” This MS. is pro-
bably of the close of the thirteenth century. There exist other MSS. of this
tract, which has been attributed to John de Garlandia3 it has been printed
by Mr. Wright in the collection of vocabularies published by Mt. Mayers·

The text there given, accompanied by numerous English glosses, is taken
from Harl. MS. 1002, fol. 113, ecee. xv„ but the text is probably of
earlier date. At the end is written, “ explicit liber equus caballus;'’ and
hence it may be conjectured that Distigt‘us is the same treatise asthat cited
in the Promptorium as “liber equi.’' See p. xxxv. infi‘a. This curious vocabu-
lary contains a considerable proportion of words adopted from the Greek,
and in one of the MSS. 1 find the following observation‚ “ Intencio est que-

dam vocabula ex Grecis extorta provectis proferre, et etiam fatuis et stolidis
qui volunt esse magistri antequam sciant.”⁶ ‘

tury.‘¹ He was a native of England, educated at Paris and Oxford;
