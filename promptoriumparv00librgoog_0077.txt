I have found no clue to the author3 the dialectieal peculiarities seem to
indicate that it was compiled in the N Orth-Eastern parts of England3
amongst names of places occurring in it, besides London, Salisbury‚ Bath,
Oxford and Cambridge, Ι notice Norwich, Lincoln, York, Richmond,
Ripon, Durham, and Carlisle ; no other places in the N orth-Western coun-
ties, however, are found. The chief authors and Latin works cited are
virgil, Ysidore, Papias, Brito, Hugutio, the Catholicon, the Doctrinale,
the gloss on the Liber Equivocorum (by John de Garlandia); many hexa-
meter verses also are given from some popular grammatical work, possibly
by that writer. A fenny district may have been familiar to the author, since
amongst other words we find sedge and sedge hill, rush and rush hill,
namely, as Ι imagine, the stack or pile of sedge or rushes3 also reed and
reed bed, fen, marsh, “ natte '' and ‘⁶ natte ’² maker, “ schergrysse,
careoe,’' ‘⁴ jonkett for fish, nassa,’' διο. On the reverse of the last leaf is
the following indication of a former owner :—“ Liber Thome Flowre Succ'

author’s holograph.b At the endis found a Latin and English list of terms
of consanguinity commencing “ Hic pater, a fader,” dcc.

occurs amongst the prebendaries of that church in 15⁷1. The owner of the MS. above
described may have been of Lincoln College, Oxford ; Thomas Flower was one of the
praetor: of the university in 1619. Le Neve, edit. Hardy, vol. iii. p. 48&

country where the author lived. We find the belief in the Iyniefatuus, which ia still
