bring under consideration. Ι may refer to his erudite account of Elyot,
Oooper, and Holyoke, by whom the revival of learning in the sixteenth
century was essentially aided in this country.⁸ To the “ Copious Dic-
tionary ’² of Francis Gouldman‚ however, published at a comparatively late
time, in 1664, and often cited in my noteS, I would advert not merely as
combining the labors of his learned predecessore, of whom an ample notice
is set forth in the Preface, but as containing archaisms os interest to the
student of language, with certain expressions mostly of N Orth-country
vernacular. Το Dr. J amieson's Dictionary of the Scottish Language I
have also often been indebted‚ and scarcely less frequently to the re-
searches of Brockett, of Hunter, and of others to whose timely care we owe
the preservation of many of the fast-fading traces of provincial dialectS.¹’

Whilst the foregoing pages were in the prees, Sir Frederic Madden‚ to
whose friendly assistance I have frequently been indebted‚ has called
my attention to a writer who probably may have been the authority often
cioed by the compiler of the Promptorium as “ Mirivalensis in Campo
Florum,” and whom, as before stated, Ι have long in vain sought to
identify. -

Leland has given many particulare relating to “Thomas Guallensis,

'³ 1 may refer to the Bibliographieal List of works illustr-stiva of the Provincia! Dialects

of Englanss by John Bussell Smith, Lond. 1839, in which various volumes occasionally
cited in the notes and not enumerated above will be found. The numerous additions to

this class of philological literature render sn enlarged edition of ΜΓ. Russell Smith’s
useful Hand-list very desii-able.

⁰ Probably for Walleis or Waleys, as he is sometimes called. Leland cites several of
his mtises on the authority of Leander Albertus, de Viris Illustr., lib. iv. It may be
well to notice that there was a writer of an earlier period, Iohannes Guallensis, a Fran.
ciscan of Worcester, about 1260, of whose voluminous works see Bale, p. 317, Pisa,
p. 3423 some confusion seems to have arisen in regar-d to his writings and those of
Thomas Guallensis. There was moreover another Thomas, professor of theology at
Oxfoffl, in the time os Henry 111„ elected Bishop of st. David's in 1247.
