the authorities, which are omitted in his printed work. The following
notices of the Campus Florum occur at fol. 30, but not under the author’s
name :—“ Campus Florum vocabularius quidam erat apud Miram vallem,
locum devotis monachis valde amenum, factus circa annum Domini
1359.—-Nicholaus Βνίραπ in Collectz‘om'bus.

Campus Florum (Thomas Gualensis interlined) li. i.; incipit, ‘ Disciplina
claustrali'deditus apud Miram vallem.’ Claruit autor anno Domini 1359.
-Eoe C'olleqio Magdalene Oxon.”

Under the article of Thomas Walleys, fol. 176, the work is thus noticed
more briefiyt—-“ Thomas Walleys DominicanuS, doctor Wallicus,'‘ Sec.
and at the end of the list of his writingS‚—“ Campus Florum, copiosus
index juris Canonici. li. i.—Eae Lelando de viris illustr-thus?

Nicholas Brigan, or Brigham, called by Bale in his printed work
“ Brigamu8‚” was his contemporary,—“ Anglicarum antiquitatum amator
maximus;” he compiled, about 1550, certain collectione which seem to
have been used by Bale, entitled “ Venationes rerum memorabilium,'’ also
“ Rerum quotidianorum, lib. xii.” Bale, Script.‚ p. 7 181Δ

Sir Frederic Madden notices that the name “ Thomae Gualensis ” had
been added above the line in the passage above cited; he considers this
interlineation to be Subsequent to the original entry, but not later than
1552, the latest date that he found in the volume. It would seem that
Bale had really seen a copy of the work at Magdalen College; he certainly
assumes that Thomas Walleys was the author. No MS. corresponding
with his description appears to be found at the present time, and I have
sought for it in vain, either in the. enumeration of MSS. in the library
of Magdalen College, given about 1697 in Catal. MSS. AngL, tom. 1,
part 2, p. 71, οι· in the recent and valuable catalogue compiled by Mr.
Goxe. I have been equally unsuccessful in my endeavors to trace the
MS. described by Leland as existing in the Public Library at Oxford.

⁸ Pin, p. 749, writes in commendationi of the eruditiori of Brigham‚ of his repnte as a
lawyer, historiam, poet, and antiquary. In 1655 Brigham caused the remains of Chaucer

to bc removed to the ehapel os st. Blaise iu Wcstminster Abbey, and depositcd in the
marble tomb which bears a Latin verse composed by him. See Wood's Atheuae.
