a ii. to n iii. On the title f. 1, “ Promptorium paruulorum clericorum‚” ἀοι
as in W. de Worde’s edition before described, a woodcut is introduced
portraying the author seated at a desk. On the reveme is the prologue,
“ cernentibus,” dac. On f. 2 commence the “ Nomina A.-—-1ncipit liber qui
dicitur Promptorium paruulorum sive clericorum.” At the end is the
colophon, ‘⁴ Ad tandem, dcc. Impressum per egregium J ulianum nota-
rium Impressorem commorantem extra temple barre sub Intersignio Sanc—

die Augusti.” On the reverse is a woodcut measuring 53 inches by 3 inches,
being the device of the printer, a tree to which is appended a helm and an
escutcheon charged with J ulian's mark and initials. Around the tree are
animale, birds, a butterfly‚ &0³

A few various readings obtained from the editions by Wynkyn de
Worde and Julian N otary are indicated in the present work by the
initials (W) and (J) respectively.

1 have now described, with minuteness of detail which, 1 sear, some
may regard as tedicus, all the MSS. and printed texts of the Promp-
torium known to me ; and these have been collated in the preparation
of the present edition. On a former occasion 1 stated the grounds of
preference which influenced me in selecting the Harleian MS. 221 as
the groundwork and text of the present edition, and I pointed out that
all additions are distinguished from the text by being placed within
brackets with the authority for their introduction, each word or various
reading being followed by an initia] indicating the source whence it is ·
derived.

The contractions have been printed in exteram, with a few exceptions
where any doubt could arise3 thus the letter li is found with the trans-
verse stroke usually indicating an e, but accompanied also by that letter, as

⁸ Biblioth. GrenV. p. 6762 Dibdin, Typ. Antiq. vol. fl. p. 585. Herbert quotes it eins
am, which seems to show that he had neverseen it. 1 may here recall, among many kind·
nones of a highly-volumi ffiend, the Rev. S. R. Maitland, the communication of his dis-
covery, in 1843, of four leaves in a volume in the Lambeth library, used as [ly-leaves,
and which 1 identified as fragments ot the rare edition by Julian Notary. They are
sign. b iii. and n ii. This fragment is noticed by Dr. Maitland in his List of some of the
early printed books in the Archiepiscopal Library, 1843, p. 464, and in an Index of such
English books printed before 1600 asaro in that collection, 184⁵. p. 120.
