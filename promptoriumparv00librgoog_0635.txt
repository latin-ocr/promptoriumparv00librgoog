¹ Iu the Harl. MS„ which has been used as the text in preparing this edition ol the
Promptorium, no uniform rule appears to heve been laid down in regurd to the use of the
Anglo-Ssxon character b, in placo os which Th constantly wcurs, probably through
cas-elessuess of the transcribet. Here, however, the words thus commencing are found in
the usual position assigned to 1), towards the close of the Anglo—Saxon alphabet3 each
being nocompsnied by the same word, written with Th, as it its more recondite or
trebatio form required such explanation. These circumstances are not undeserving ol
notice. In the King's Collega MS. the repetition is not found, the words being written
with b only. In the Middle Hill MS. they ere written thus—stne or thann-Yowtyng
or thowtyng‚ the character ῖ being uniformly used in that MS. iustesd of b. In the Win-
chester MS. l> is commonly, but not invni-inm„ used throughout, and the words in this
portion of the alphabet ere written without uniformity. Pyneon and J ulinn Notnry printed
invariebly with Υ for b, nnd, in the copy of the rnre edition by the former in the Roynl
Librnry, British Museum, the following MS. note is found: ‘⁴ All these Y. stsnde for Th.
ecordinge as the Sason correcte was in this sorte—b, sud so we prououuce all these
wordes st this day with Th.” In W. de Worde’s edit. 1516. the whole of the above are
omitted, and, immediately &fter the alphabetioal section W, follow Υι, stynge, δια, to
the close. printed with Y. instead of 3, ns iu all the other texts which heve been snilsble
for collation. This may, however, be merely n typographica! error.
