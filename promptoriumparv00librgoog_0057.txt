only3 in those which I have seen I perceived no essential variatione in the
text. A copy of that of 1516, formerly in Heber's library and obtained
by Sir Frederic Madden in 1836, has been, among many kindnesses which
1 have received at his hands, entrusted for my use throughout the prepa-
ration of this volume.⁸ Occasionally the Latin-English dictionary, Ortus
Vocabulorum, printed by the same print-er and in the like form, is found
bound up with the Promptorium for the convenience of studente. Dibdin
remarks that Wynkyn de Worde’s Promptuarium Parvulorum was an
abridgment of the dictionary of which the editio princeps had issued from
Pynson's presa with the title ‘⁴ Promptorius puerorum ”3 the omissione are
principally, however, of some portions of the Latin explanations, and of
references to authorities, whilst occasionally English synonyms, Cae. are
added in the smaller volume. The variations in the title may be without
any material significance. The following brief description of this rare

book will here suffice.¹’

The volume consiste of 69 leaves, sign. A. ij. to M. iij. ς it is printed in
double columns, with running titles distinguishing the Nomina from the
Verba, as in Pynson’s edition.

Tine—‘⁸ Promptuarium paruulorum clericorum: quod apud nos Medulla
grammatice appellatur. Scolasticis quam maxime necessarium. Impres-
sum Londoniis per wynandum de worde hac in vrbe in parochia sancte
Brigide (in the fletestrete) ad signum solis commorantem.” On the title is
introduced the well-known wood—cut device used by Wynkyn de Worde,

in 4. de 70 ff„ reimpr. en 1622 et en 1528st Ῑ am not aware on what authority thia
mention of any edition without date ia made. The Ortus Vocabulorum having been printed
by W. de Worde in 1600, aa hereafter noticed, it may be supposed that he likewiae pro·
duced an edition 01 the Promptorium about the same period aa a convenient accompani-
ment. Nono has been found earlier than the edition of 1510, which ia described by
Dibdin aa the first stom that prena. He mentions a fine copy in the late ΜΓ. Roget
wil-baham& library. .

⁸ This copy ia in old brown cali, and in good conditiong the Ortus Vocabulorum,
edit. 1518, precedes the Promptorium. The name ‘⁶ Mylles Blomefylde of Bury St.

Edmunde’· ia written several times on the title pages. ‘⁶ Mylea Blomsfylde owe thia
booke,” διο. Another copy of the Promptorium, edit. 1516, isin the Grenville Library

in the Britiah Musenm, and also one 01 edit. 1528. A fine clean copy of edit. 1516
ia in the Public Library at Cambrid303 another ia in the Bodleian, Tanner 0011. No. 271.
