¹ The pectoral, as a sacred ornament used by the prelates of the Christian church,
appears to have derived its origin from the jewelled breast-plate os the Jewish high-
priest, the λογεῖον ram κρίσεων, or rationale judicii, according to the Vulgate, Exod.
xxviii. 15, rendered in the earlier Wicliffite version ‘⁸ the breest broche of dom,” in the
later ‘⁴ the racional os doom.” It was worn attached to the breast of the chasuble, and
although never, as it appears, in general use, yet many examples present themselves in
England· As regards the obscure subject of the early use of the rationale, much infor-
mation may be gained from the authors cited by Ducange. It is minutely described in
an ancient inventory of pontifical ornaments at Rheims, given by Marlot in the Hist. of
that see, and appears to have closely resembled the J ewish breast-plate, being formed of
12 atonem whereon the names of the 12 sons of Israel were inscribed, fixed upon eloth
of gold, and attached by means of chains over the shoulders, whereupon also there were
two stones called ‘⁶ cansayeuoe,” in imitation of those which were worn by the high-
priest. A second rationale for less solemn occasions is described in the same document,
which resembled less closely the Jewish ornament: it was formed of one stone of un-
usual brilliancy and size, called ‘⁸ camayeu,'’ around which were set 4 emeralds, and as
many balais rubies. A representation of this remarkable ornament may be seen in the
plate given by Du Bouchet‚ in the Hist. of the House of Courtenay, p. 174, which
represents the sepulchral effigy of Robert de Courtenay, Archbishop of Rheims, who
died 1323. The most remar able representation which exists in England is afforded by
the effigy placed under Prince Arthur’s chantry in worcester cathedral, and attributed
to Bp. Godfrey Giffard, 1268-1301. The rationale here appears as a square plate
upon the breast of the chasuble, with a quatrefoil in the centre, and set with eight
gems. This ornament appears iu England chiefly during the XIIIth cent. See the
seals of J ocelim. ΒΡ. Bath, and John, Bp. Winch. 1205 3 of Eustace. Bp. Lond. 1222,
Walter, ΒΡ. Carlisle, 1223, Ralph, Bp. Heres. 1239, Sylvester, B . Carlisle, 1246,
Hem-y, Bp. Lincoln‚ 1300; and the effigy of ΒΡ. Laurence, at Roc ester, who died
127 4. ln the Invent. of St. Paul’s, 1295, given by Dugdale, several chasuble· are
described as furnished with the pectorale, formed of gold, or cloth of gold, set with
gems. Its use was not entirely abandoned at a later period ε it appears upon the seal
of Richard, ΒΡ. Lincoln, 1420, and in the Invent. taken at winchester cathedral at the
Dissolution, occur a pectoral of goldg another partly of gold, and six of silver gilt, all
garnished with stones. Strype’s Mem. of Cranmer, App. p. 25. The term pectoral
occasionally designatas an ornament of the eope, as in the Invent. taken at St. Paul’s,
and given by Dugdale, in which mention occurs of a ‘⁴ capa, cum Petro et Paulo in
