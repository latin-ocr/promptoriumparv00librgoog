¹ The term habel-geon appears properly to be a diminutive of hurbes-k, although here
given as synonymous. Wace, in his Roman de Rou, written about 1160. describes the
Conqueror as armed. at the battle of Hastings, with a “boen hawbm,·” but Odo, his
half-brother, Bishop of Bsyeux, who could not decorously assume the complete military

equipment‚ and rode with a staff merely ιο stimulate the oombatants, provided himself
with this pastial defence.

The pmcept of Randolph 111„ Earl of chester, to his barone, about the close ot the
Xlllth cent. requires that their knights and free tenants should have ‘⁶ loricas, et katt-
beryella,·” and the ordinsuee of Heu. 111. 1252, “super jamnis ad arma‚” directs that
every man. according to the rate of his land and chameis, should arm himself either
with the lorica, the haber-qaum, called also in this document haubercus. or the per·
puuctum. The stet. of winchester, 13 Edw. 1. 1285, makes the same distinction between
the haubery’, hauberyeon, and par-point, to be used hy the three classes respectively‚
according to their assmment. Stat. os Realm, i. 97. From these authorities it is evident
that the habergeon was a defenoe of an inferior description to the han-berk5 and when
the introduction of plate armour in the reign of Edw. 111. had supplied more convenient
end effeetual defences sor the legs and thighs, the long skirt of the hawberk became
superfluous3 from that period the habergeon alone seems to have been worn. This, ”
in its turn, being superseded by the caira-w, was reduced to the mere apron of massg
but at the time when the Promptorium was compiled, the expensive nature of plato
armour caused its use to be restricted. and combatants of the lower classes were content

33 Heu. vl. relating to armour delivered out of the Tower, are mentioned ‘¹ haberg'ons,
some of Meleyn, and some of Westewale,'’ that is, probably, Westphalia, or the Wester-
