2. MS. in the Library of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, shelf-
mark D. 23 it was entrusted to me by their kind permission through the
request of Sir Henry Ellis, to whom I acknowledge with pleasure my
frequent obligations, It is written on paper in a small clear hand, in
double columnS, with initials in blue and red; the English words also are
iu red. It begins with the short prologus above noticed, but, part of the
leaf being torn away, the first lines are mutilated; this prologue ends
thus—“ Et sic propter vocabulorum copiam liber iste Medulla gramatice
intitulatur.” This MS. is in the original stamped binding with boards,
probably of oak3 it is doubtless the same which occurs in the list of
MSS. at Canterbury Cathedral about 1697, as “ Dictionarium dictum Me-
dulla Grammaticae.'’⁸ This venerable relic of fifteenth-century learning
has been regarded with special interest on account of the addition of
numerous Anglo-Saxon words, as supposed, by Somner; the MS. of whose
Anglo-Saxon Dictionary is in the Canterbury Library. From the manner,
however, in which the Anglo- Saxon words are given, it may be inferred
that they were, at least in part, taken from some Vocabulary in Somner's
possession not his own compilation. The English portion is full, and
contains curious archaisms, including a considerable proportion of words
noticeable as retained in N &th-country dialects.¹’

3. Harl. ΜΒ. 1000. An imperfect copy, ending with the words
“ stamen est filum tele or warpe.” On paper3 written in a neat hand3
late fifteenth century3 with rubrications.

4. Harl. MS. 1738. The Medulla in a very abridged form, in a clear

on the reverse is rudely sketohed with the pen Our Lord rising from the Sepulchra. On
the third leaf, νο. are two short Latin poema in hexameter-s, the first beginning thus:
“Siccine tam crebris frustra commeatibus anglos ;'’ the secondz ‘⁴ Conveniunt gallos
crebris conventibus angust· At the end: ⁴⁴ 'rhys ys Rycbard . . . . . ys boke.’' It may
deterre mention that after certain words of ill omen the sign of the crosa is found, thus:
Diabolus, the deuel. ᾖ Demon, the deuel. ᾖ Dis, the deuel. ᾖ Commius, the

fallinge euel. ᾖ Epilencia, the fallinge euel. ᾖ Febricito, to haue the seuerus. ἧς

Geumi-im, that vseth hore hona. ᾖ 1 have notieed occasionally a similar practice in
other MSS. of the period.
