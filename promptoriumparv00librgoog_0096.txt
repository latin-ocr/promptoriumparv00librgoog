dictus ;” a Dominican whose commentarios on various books of the Old
Testament he had seen in the library of Warden Abbey, Bedfordshire.
Among-st numerous writings of this author, probably of Welsh origin,
Leland thus mentions one existing at Oxford in the Public Library :—
“ Extat in bibliotheca publica Isiaci liber, cui titulus Campus Florum, a
Guallensi scriptus, copiosus videlicet J uris Canonici index.” Leland ob-
serves that previous writers had not ascribed a date to the works of Gual-
lensis3 according to his own conjecture that eminent scholar lived about
the times of Edward IL Comm. de Script. Brit, vol. ii„ p. 333.

Bale and Pits give some additional notice8.⁸ From the former we
learn that Thomas Walleys (alias Gualensis) a theologian of Oxford, was
a strenuous opponent of tenets advanced by Pope John XXIII„ and that
in consequence, about the year 1332, he suffered imprisonment. Bale
gives a list of treatises attributed to Walleys‚ including one thus entitlod:
“ Campum Florum duris Canonici, lib. i. Dz'scszlina claustrali deditus.”
The enumeration of his writings is augmented by Pits, with references to
MSS. in the collegiate libraries of both the universities. This list in-
cludes several MSS. in the library of St. Peter‘s college, Cambridge, and
it may deservo notice that 1 there found, as previously stated (p. xxv.
supra), a treatise entitled “Campus Florum,” and also several works attri-
buted to Johannes Wallensis. of the author, however, of the “ Campus
Florum’' there preserved, Ι have found no indication3 it commences with
the words “ Fulcite me floribus‚’' which differ, as will presently appear,
from those given as the incipial words of the treatise by Thomas Walleis
to which my attention has been called by Sir Frederic Madden.

It is stated by Pits that Thomas Walleis, or Guallensis, lived in 1333;
according to some accounts, however, he was living as late as 1410.

The autograph Collections by Bishop Bale, alphabetically arranged, for
the continuation of his work, are preserved, as I am informed by Sir
Frederic Madden‚ in the Bodleian Library amongst Seldeu's MSS. (N 0.
64, B.; No. 3452, Codd. J0. Seldeni, Catal. MSS. Angliae). They were
compiled after the first edition printed at Ipswich in 1548, and before
that, largely augmented, printed at Basle in 1557. These Collections well
deserve to be printed, as Sir Frederic observes ; their value being greatly
enhanced by the circumstance that, in all instances, Bale has stated
