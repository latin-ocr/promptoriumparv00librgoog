(25.) ‘⁴ Lesclareissement de la langue Francoyse,’‘ by John Palsgrave,
1530.-A minute description of this important book, which is dedicated to
Henry V111.· is given by Dibdin‚ and more recently by M. Genin in the
Introduction to the reprint edited by him for the collection of ‘⁴ Documenta
Inedits sur l'histoire de France.’'¹³ The work, the earliest existing grammar
of the Freneh tongue, consiste of mles for pronunciation, a very full voea-
bulary of substantives in English and French alphabetically arranged,
similar tables of pronouus, adjectives, and other parts of speech, an
ample list of verbs being specially valuable to the student of obsolete
expressione, on account of the quaint sentences by which each verb is
illustrated, The author, who styles himself in the Title “ Angloys natyf
de Londres, et gradue de Paris,” and who studied also both at Cambridge
and Oxford‚ had been chosen to instruct the Lady Mary, sister of Henry
VIII„ previously to her marriage with Louis XII. In the Privy Purse
Expenses of Henry VIII., 1513, Palsgrave is designated ‘⁶ scolemaster to
my lady Princes,” and he accompanied her to Franco in the following year.
His services are very favorably recognised by Henry in the privilege for
seven years prefixed to the work, and dated Sept. 2, 22 Heu. VIII. (1530),
shortly after its completion, as thus stated in the colophon,—“ The imprint-
yng fynysshed by Johan Haukyns the xv111. daye of July,” in the year
beforementioned. It has, however, been supposed that the book may have
been produced from the press of Pynson, by whom it is certain that copies
were sold under the author’s direction.⁰ On his return from Franoe with
the youthful Queen, Palsgrave was much in request as a teacher of the
young nobility; he enjoyed considerable preferment in the chureh, and
was collated by Cranmer to the rectory of St Dunstan's in the East,
