and a few words scarcely legible, which may be read—‘⁶ Ex providencia
Willelmi Grene,'’ whose name occurs repeatedly elsewhere as before
noticed; he may have been either the scribe or the donor.

In the present edition all various readings and additions obtained by
collation of this MS. are indicated by the letter (S). It is with grateful
satisfaction that I would express my acknowledgment of the liberality of
the Dean and Chapter in entrusting to me, through the friendly mediation
of Mr. Vaux, a volume of such value, and from which Ι have derived
much assistance in my undertaking.

5. MS. in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart., collated, by his
kind permission‚ at Middle Hill (No. 8306, Heber Library No. 1360). It
is on paper, dimensions 113 inches by δὲ inches. The writing is in
double columns in a small neat hand of the close of the fisteenth century
with rubricated initials3 the English words are underlined with red. The
Promptorium extends to p. 166. On the first column of p. 167 is
written in red ink, “ Explicit liber dictus Promtorius Paruulorum,'’ &c-
as in other MSS. and immediately after, ‘⁸ Brooke owyt yis Boke hoso
wyssly loke.’' The name of this former owner, “ J oh’es Broke,” occurs
repeatedly, also ‘⁶ Thomas Wade,” and, in a handwriting of later‘date
(ἲ xvii. saec.), “ Henry Sherbrooke.’' On the second or right-hand column
of p. 167 commences the Latin-English Dictionary entitled “ Medulla
Grammatice‚” and written apparently by the same scribe as the Prompto-
rius. It is imperfect in several parts,⁸ and ends with the word “ Ticio,
onis, a brond of fyre‚'‘ p. 342⁶ In this MS. y is used instead of Ρ. Α few
peculiarities in spelling deserve notice3 for instance, almyhty‚ bryth, fiyht,
seythtyn, lyth, syth, ryth, nyth, instead of almyghty, bryght‚ διας qwat,
qul‚ qhyp‚ qhyth, dcc. for what, whyle, whyppe, dcc. The verbs some-
times terminate in -ng‚ thus, “ Betydyng‚ happyng.”

In the present edition all various readings and additions obtained by
collation of this MS. are indicated by the letter (H).
