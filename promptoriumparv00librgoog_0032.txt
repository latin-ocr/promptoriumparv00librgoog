Numerous MSS. of the Vocabiczarium of Uguitio exist, but it does not

3. Etim—The treatise by william Brito, to which frequent refer-
ence is made by the compilet of the Promptorium, is probably his “ Summa,
sive opusculum difficilium vocabulorum Biblie,” an explanatory Glossary
of words occurring in Holy Writ, sometimes entitled “ Lexicon sive Voca-
bularium Biblie,” or, as described by Fabricius, “ Vocabularius cum
vocabulorum Hebraicorum in Bibliis occurrentium interpretatione Latina.”
Some account of this work may be found in Du Gange's Preface to hie
Glossary, § 49, edit. Henschel, t. i. p. 30, and Bandinius, Codd. Lat. t. iv.

verses :—

Pendet-03 sed nequeo latebras nisi qui manifestat

Auxiliante Deo, διο.
