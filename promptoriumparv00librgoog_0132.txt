² ‘⁸ Beni-werde, yar-deur d’osrs.” ruso. A curious representation of the bear-ward.

end bsiting the bear, occurs in the Louterel Psslter, illuminated in the early pert of the
reign of Edw. 111. It hss been engrsved in Vetust. Monuni. VI. pl. xxiv. In the
Household Book os the Esrl of Northumberlsnd in 1511, under the head of Rewsrds,
is one of “6s.8d. to the Kyngs or Queenes Bai-ward, if they have one‚'’ when they
oome to the Esrl, Ant. Rep. xv, p. 253. The Esrl had also in his own family sn official
of the same kind, whose reward was 202. Shskespesre uses the word, sud also
besrsrd or beer-yerd, which are synonymous.

⁸ Beryl is used by Ohsueer end the authors of the XIVth end xvth centuries to
denote the precious stone so called, and also a finer description of crystsl glans, which
resembled it in trsnspsreucy or colour. This distinction is not preserved hei-eg but it
is made by Pslsgrave: “,Bersll fyue glsss‚beril.Be1-yll,s precious stone, ἶκτ-ἰί.ν

Lnrc, to kepe yn corne, which occurs above, end in the printed editions is spelled
ωηεν. Α. S. bere, hordeum, lesp, corbis.

⁸ Alexander Necchsm, who died m 1227, gives in his trestise de naturis rerum, a curious
sceouut‘ ‘de ave que vulgo dieitur bernekkess' which grew ss he asserts, from wood
steeped in thesea, or trees growing on the shores. Roy. MS. 12 G. XI. f. 31. The
marvellous tales respecting this bird, which has been supposed to be the chenalopeces,
mentioned by Pliny ss a native of Britain, are to he found in length in Gesner, Ola'us
Magnus, and many ancient writers. Giraldus gives in his Topographis Hibernia, o. xi. α’
detailed account ‘⁸ de hernac-is εκ abiete nascentibus? ss s phenomenon of which he hsd'
been sn eye-witness on the Irish shores, end states that these birds were, on account of
their half-fishy exn-action, eaten during Lent. This indulgence, of which the propriety
was argued by Michael Meyer in his trestise ds volum-i arborea, wss sanctioned by the
authority of the Sorbonne.1t is scarcely needfnl to observe that the origin of these
strange statements is to be found in the multivalve shell -,flsh the lepos ouantem, which
