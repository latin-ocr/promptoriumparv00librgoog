compilet of the Promptorium. In the Glossary to Hearne’s edition of
Langtoft's Chronicle, under the word “Nesshe,” the following statement
appears: “Maken nesshe is interpreted mollzflco and melleo (so ’tis ex-
pressed sor mollio‚) in the Promptorium parvulorum sive clericorum (call'd
also Medulla Grammaticae), a very scarce folio book printed by Richard
Pynson in the year 1499, being the 14th year of the reign of King Henry
VII. at which time it was look'd upon as a work of great use and excel-
lency, as may appear from this printed note at the end. Ἥ Ad laudem et
ad honorem,” διο. (as given in the account of Pynson’s edition, p. xlii. infra.)
‘⁴ The author was a preaching or black Fryer, and follow’d the dialect
of the East parts of England, to which he had been used from his infancy,
as he tells us in his Prologue. His name was Richard Frauncis, as I find
by this note written in an old hand at the beginning of a copy of this book
that was lent me by Mr. Ward of Longbridge‚ viz. ‘J Nomen Compilato-
ris istius libri est Frater Ricardus FraunceS, inter quatuor parietes pro
Christo inclusus.”⁸ Against this statement, however, whicDis at most
the anonymous note or tradition of some previous possessor of the book,
may be cited, first, an entry of equal authority in a copy of the same
edition by Pynson in the public librat-y at Cambridge—“ Autor hujus
operis fuit Galfredus Grammaticus dictus, frater Ordinis S. Dominici.'’
To this friar we find the authorship ascribed by the learned Bale, Bishop of
Ossory, himself an East-Anglian‚ not indeed under the title of the Prompto-
rium, but as the Medulla Grammatices‚ distinctly identified however by
the incipial words of the Preamlmlum as the work more commonly known
by the name first mentioned. Bale, whose Catalogue of the writers of
Great Britain was published at Basle in 1557 ,b writes also thus with his
accustomed critical asperity :—“ Galfridus Grammaticu8‚ ad scholas semper
a puero nutritus, sub corrupti8‚ obscuris, ac barbaris praeceptoribus, prima
ejus artis rudimenta edoctus, corruptior ipse aliorum tandem magister
evasit. Sibi ipsi nihilominus, non aliter quam olim arrogans ille Palaemon‚
adfectus, multa tribuebat, tanquam essent cum eo nato simul et bonae
literae, et bene dicendi artes obortae, atque cum eo demum moriente et illae
simul essent interiturae. Ciceronem, Salustium, Servium, Plinium, Var-
ronem, Vergilium, Horatium, Quintilianum, et alios bonos authores in

¹² In the first edition, printed at Ipewich, 1548, the notice of Galfridns varies only in a
few particulare from that above cited.
