Resides the editions issued from the press of Wynkyn de Worde, two
printed in Franco, and not mentioned by Dibdin or other bibliographers,
remain to be noticed. The first of these was printed for Jaques Cousin, of
Rouen, in 1520. The only copy known to me is in the Grenville Library

in the British Museum. In dimensione and general arrangement, the book
· closely resembles the small quartos by W. de Worde ; on the first leaf is
introduced a woodcut of the arms of the city of Rouen, the escutcheon is
supported by two rams, aud over it on a scroll is the motto ‘⁴ In te iesu
spes mea.” On the field of the escutcheon appear the printer’s initials,
and under it is a scroll inscribed ‘⁴ Jaques: cousin.” The title is as
follows, printed at the head of the page, over the woodcut :—

“ ΊῘ Ortus vocabulorum Alphabetico ordine fere omnia que in Catholico.
Breuiloquio. Cornucopia. Gemma vocabulorum atque Medulla grammatice
ponuntur, cum vernacule lingue Anglicane expositione continens: nouiter

Impressus Anno salutis vicesimo supra millesimum et quingentesimum.
Die vero vicesima septima mensis J unii.”

On the reverse of the leaf is found the “ Prologus‚” as before. The
dictionary is printed in double columns, Sign. A. ii. to LL. iii. On the
reverse of the last leaf is the colophon :—

“ Adest studiosissimi . . . . Quum ’igitur summa diligentia sit collectum
vigilantique studio correctum z vt maius in lucem prodiret: ipsum a viris
studiosis comparandum esse constat. Impressum. Per Magistrum Petrum
Oliuier optimis caracteribus. Anno salutis christiane vigesimo supra
millesimum et quingentesimum Die vero quinta mensis Octobris.’'⁸

Dimensions, 7 3 inches by 5 inches. Mr. Grenville observed that this

edition is not mentioned by Panzer, Maittaire, or in any work which he
had seen.

The second edition, to which allusion has been made as produced on the
continent, was likewise printed at Rouen‚ at the joint costs of a bookseller
of that city and of another, John Gachet, “ mercatoris librarii,” as he is
elsewhere designated, and who appears to have carried on his trade at

⁸ A missal of salisbury use is mentioned in Ames' Typ. Ant. by Herbert, printed at
Rouen in 1521 by Peter Oliver for Jaquea eumin. 1 am unable to account for tho
discrepancy in date which may bo noticed in the colophon as compared with the title,

unless we may suppose that the printing commenood on June 27, and that nearly four
months were required for its completioni.
