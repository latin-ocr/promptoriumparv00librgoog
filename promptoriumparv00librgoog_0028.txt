a blunder as worse than a crime: ‘ I humbly with prayers entreat all
pedagogues‚ teachers‚ and masters, that when they have examined this
little work, they will approve what may by God‘s assistance have been
rightly written, and will piously correct and emend what is written ill or
erringly3 since humble grammarians and boys may look on this short
volume as on a mirror, and find freely and immediately the common words
which belong ιο the Latin tongue.’ ”⁸

Fortunate indeed had it been if the original conscientiously elaborated
by Geoffrey's own hand had been preserved to our times. We should
not have been exposed to manifold perplexities occasioned by vitia-

Scarcely inferior in interest to the Promptorium‚ as an aid ιο the
