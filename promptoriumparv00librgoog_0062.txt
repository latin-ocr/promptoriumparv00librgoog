Ι. Mannnm GnAmunon on GaAuuArmEs. -This is the earliest Latin·
English Dictionary known to me, and it is supposed to have been compiled
by the author of the Promptorium. On this account, and also in con-
sideration of its value to the student of the language of the period, Ι
have thought it desirable to give a somewhat detailed description of the
MSS. that Ι have been able to discover, all of them being of the later
half of the fisteenth century, and including those in which, as previously
stated, very great modificatione of the text will be found, although, as on
eareful examination Ι have been led to suppose, they are substantially
identieal with the Medulla and may properly be classed with it. See
p. xxu.

1. Ι have not met with any copy of earlier date than a MS. in my
own possession, obtained about 1841 from the late Mr. Rodd. It is a
small solie, containing 116 leaves of parchment, written in double columns
very legibly by two different hands; the initials are rubrieated. There
is a prologue commencing thus :—“ Hee est regula generalis pro toto libro.
Omnia nomina, verbalia, et partieipia habent significationem verborum a
quibus descendunt secundum eorum formam et anologiam, dae—Fructum
gramatice pueris do sub brevitate. Incipit liber intitulatus Medulla
gramatice.” The dictionary then begins with—‘⁴ Alma . i . virgo abscondita
vel absconsio virginitatis,” and concludes—‘⁴ Zonigogo, as, to gyrd vp.—
Explieit Medulla Gramatice.'' The date of this MS„ which is in excellent
preservation and in the original wooden boards covered with leather, may

be about 1460.ει

⁸ On the first of three leaves of parchment bound in at the begInning is written, in a
hand contemporary with the MS.. “ Brother Wylliam Barker 1 pray youe lett thye booke
be bounde at the vtmoste by myddyll lent and my brother shalle pay for the byndynge ;”
