juxta tumbam S. Wiisiniss’ Gottonian MS. Vesp. B. xnv. This lectern is represented
in the Archaeologia, xvii. pl. 23. A lectern of marble, resembling such as is quai-ried
in Derbyshire‚ exists at Crowle‘ m Worcestershine3 it appears to be a work of the Xllth
century. Another beautifully- sculptured specimen is preserved in the ancient abbatial
house at Weulock‚ Salop. In the former instance alone, the arrangement whereby· the
desk was supported on small columns may be ascertained. Of the moveable lecterns of
a later period, numerous specimens have eseaped the ravages οἱ the XVlth and xvnth
centuries. Carved lecterns of wood exist at Bury, Huntingdonshire‚ date about 1300;
at Rsmsey ς Swanscombe and Lenhsm in Kent; Hawsted in Suffolk ; and in many other
chnmhes. Th0se ol' brass are mostly of the xvth century, or later date. At Rouen
Gathedral an ancient lectern of iron may be seen, which, being hinged together like a
faldistorium, and furnished with a socket for a candle on one side, might be folded up
when not in use, and laid aeide, so as not to encumber the ares of the choir. The lectern
was adorned with a covering, frequently termed the “ des—cloth,” of rich material con-
formable to the suit, or complete vestment, os which it formed a part. In the Inventory
of the Church of st. Faith, in the crypt at St. Paul's, 1298, is mentioned ‘⁴ pannus de pal
ad lectt-istium) ’⁹ In the Wardrobe Book, 27 Edw 1. amongst the furniture and orna-
ments o! the royal chapel, occurs‘ ‘unum manuleo-pium curtum. sutum de auro et serico,

¹ 'rho ‹gt-{inulam aud precise meaning of this word are exceedingly obscureg it is used
by chancer in the tale os the Cambridge scholare who came to the Miller of Trumpington
to have their grsin ground, and left their horse under a pent-house or cutbuilding‚ instead

os putting him into the ‘⁴ lathe ;'’ the miller, to play them a shrewd trick, slipped off the
bridle, and let the horse run.

“ He looked up and donne, till he had yfonnd
The clerkes horse, there as he stood ybound,
Behind the mill, under a lessel.” Reve’s Tale, 4059.

Tyrwhitt print· the word “levesell,’' and its meaning here is less obscure than in a
passage in the Persone⁸s Tale, where it again occurs. Chauoer defines the difference
between pride in the heart os man, and pride shown in external show and costly arsy ι
“ But nathelesse‚ that one of these spices of pride is signe of that other, right as the
gaye leuesell at the taverne is signe ot the wine that is in the seller.’' Speght‚ who had
here consulted the Promptorium, explains the word as signifying a bush, or a hovel,
which is repeated by Skinner‚ with the suggestion that it may be derived from the
French ‘⁴ lais, vepres, vivyulea, addita term. dim. ell.” This derivation seems little
to the purpose. According to Cotgrave lais, οι· layca, are trees lel't as marks in cutting
a eopse wood. Tyrwhitt in his notes says confidently that the word is derived from
