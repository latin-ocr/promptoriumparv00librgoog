been selected for the groundwork of the present edition, as supplying the
earliest, most ample, and most correct text among the MSS. of the work
which have come under my observation. The original by the author's
hand has not been brought to light, and there are numerous indications of
alterations in spelling and other minutiae by the transcriber. The age of
the transcript, however, may entitle it to be considered as that which
most faithfully represents the original text; it contains a much greater
number of words than are found in any other MS. or in Pynson’s and sub-
sequent editions; in addition to this a synonym or explanatory phrase is
frequently found in the Harl. MS„ contributing to elucidate the significa-
tion of some archaism which in the other texts is comparatively obscure.

2. Fragment of a copy in Harl. MS. 237 4, from which a few various
readings have been obtained3 they are in each instance indicated by the
number of the MS. It contains portions of the letters G. H. M. N. and
R.; and more nearly resembles the text of Pynson’s printed edition than
any of the other MSS. The termina—tion of the verbs is written ·ynge,
as in Grawntynge, &c-

3. MS. preserved in the Library of King’s College, Cambridge (class
mark, No. 8); a tbin volume containing 75 leaves of parchment; diinen-
sions 12 incbes by 8 inches. The writing is in double columns, in a good
legible hand of the latter part of the fifteenth century, and very uniform
throughout the book. The initials at the beginning of each letter in the
alphabetical arrangement are painted with bright opaque blue, and have
rubricated marginal flourishes, as shown in the facsimile. On the reverse
of the last leaf the donor is thus recorded, “Dedit Collegio Regali Sam.
Thom⁸s ibidem Socius 1684.” ⁸ The name, probably, of a previous pos-
sessor is written on a ily-leaf at the beginning, “ Rob’t london,'' and repeated
on the last leaf, in the same hand, “ Rob’t london nuper de Aldeby in Com.
Norff. ar.”¹’ The names, “ Thomas Wyndham,” “ J oh’es Buckenham,’' and
“ John Bayspoole,” occur also in the volume.

⁸ Samuel Thomas, possibly the donor of this book, was appointed prebendas-5 of Wells,

Aug. 3, 1681. His successor in the stall (Compton Bishop) was appoInted in 1691.

ὓ Tite family ol this name lived, according to Blomefleld (Hist. Nori. vol. viii. p. 4) at
Aldby or Aldeburgh. and had a lesse of the priory maner. He mentions three persons,

in successive generations, living there about the sixteenth century and subsequently,
each of whom bore the name ot Robert London.
