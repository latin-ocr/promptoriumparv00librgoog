10. MS. in the Library of St. John's College, Cambridge, thus described
in the Catalogue by the Rev. Morgan Cowie published by the Cambridge
Antiquarian Society, 1842, 4t0. p. 30 :—“ O. 22. Medulla Grammatices,
4t0. MS. vellum and paper, principally the latter3 with date in the same
writing as the MS. 1468. It has the name ‘ William Jenour,' but this
seems to be the name of the owner. It is a Latin Dictionary; the
explanation of the words in Latin.’' This is one of the MSS. presented
to the college by Thomas Earl of Southampton3 it is stated that
they were purchased from Mr. william Crashawe, brother of the poet, a
fellow of St. John’s admitted 1593. ⁴

11. MS. in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge, erroneously described
amongst Pepys’ MSS„ Catal. MSS. Angliae, tom. ii. p. 209, as ‘⁴ Dictio-
narium Anglo-Lat. written about A.D. 1450, fol.’' It is, however, a
Latin-English Dictionary‚ apparently a variety of the Medulla.

12. MS. in the Library at Lincoln Cathedral, written on parchment
in double columns with numerous marginal additions, It consists of
146 pages. At the end is written, “ Explicit Medulla Grammatice.” A
Latin-English vocabulary of 79 pages and three other works are bound up
in the volume, the last of these being a ‘⁴ Liber Hymnorum‘’ attributed to
GalfriduS, the author of the Promptorium. On a fly-leaf at the beginning
is written “ Gabi-idus (sic for Galfridus) Grammaticus author Anglus
vixit circa A D. 1490.” This MS. has been cited by Bishop Tanner, Bibl.
Brit. Hib. p. 305, as an English-Latin Dictionary, namely the “ Promp-
tuarium‚'' of which he mentions the MS. in Sir Symouds d'Ewes' library
(now Harl. MS. 221), and the edition by Pynson 1499. By the courtesy
of the Rev. G. F. Apthorp 1 have· been enabled to ascertain the real
description of this volume, which is in good preservation.⁸ The shelf-mark
was formerly H 35, altered in 1858, when the library was rearranged, to
A 3, 15.b

ὓ Sir Frederic Madden hu pointed out Bishop Tauner's original notes regarding the
Lincoln MSS„ as given in his voluminons collections now in the British Museum, and
ocem-ring in Add. ΜΕ. 6261, ff. 143. 171. As before mentioned, 1 have little doubt
that the slight error in the learned Bishop's account os the MS. above described may
have arinen from the title of ‘⁴ Medulla ” being occasionally given to the Promptorium in
the printed editions.
