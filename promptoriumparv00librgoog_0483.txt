¹ The pardoner was an ecclesiastic authorised by the head of the Roman Church to
travel throughout Catholic Europe for the purpose of vending pardons or indulg ences,
with the intention of raising a sum for some special purpose. chancer, in hisg lively
portraiture of the Pardoner, Cant. T. v. 710, shows the expediente and pretences to
which such itinerante had recourse, in turning to profitable account the superstition or
ignorance of the people, a practice to which a check was given by several councils.
They were termed questam-ee. or questioni-ii, in French quedem-3. Frequent allusion
is made in the Vision of Piers Ploughman to the abuse of the authority of the Church,
which rendered the credulous a prey to crafty itinerante. By Stat. 22 Heu. v111. c. 12,
all proctors and pardoners travelling the country without sufficient authority were to
be treated as vagabonds. “,Pardonere pen-demnier.'⁹ panso.
