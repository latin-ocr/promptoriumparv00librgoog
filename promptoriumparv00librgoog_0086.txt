(21.) The Book for Travellers.-The earliest printed Treatise for in-
struction in French is Caxton's “ Boke for Travellers,” thus cited in my
notes infra, and so entitled in Dibdin’s Bibl. Spenc. vol. iv. p. 319. See
also his Typ- Ant. vol. i. pp. 315, 317. This rare production of Caxton’s
press is a folio, without date, printed at westminster, as Ames supposed,
before 1484. The author has not been ascertained. It is printed in two
columns in form of a vocabulary French and English; being a compen-
dium of household matterS, animab, birds, fisheS, fruits, viands, merchan-
dise, ὣο. From the copy at Althorp, the only perfect one known to Dib-
din, previously in possession of Mr. Lister Pariter, 1 was permitted to
extract many curious illustrations of words in the Promptorium. Mt.
Blades mentions in his Life of Caxton, vol. ii. p. 133, a fine copy in the
Cathedral Library at Ripon ; another at Bamborough Castle3 an imper-
fect copy (Spencer duplicate) in possession of the Duke of Devonshir03
and a fragment, two leaves, formerly in Ames's possession, now in the
Douce collection in the Bodleian.

(22.) ‘⁴ Introductory to write and to pronounce Frenche, by Alexander
Barcley.'’—This scarce volume issued from the press of Robert Coplande:
London‚ 1521, fol. The ‚author states that he undertook the work ‘⁴ at
the eomaundement of the ryght hye, excellent, and myghty prynce, Tho-
mas, Duke of Norfolke,” namely, Thomas Howard, High Treasurer to
Henry V11.; appointed Earl Marshal 2 Hen. VIII„ chief commender at
Flodden. Sir Henry Ellis has pointed out with much probability that
Barclay ⁸ may have compiled his “ Introduotory ” from materials of earlier

new„ the traveller relates the siege of Harfleur, the memor-able battle of Agincourt, the
deaths of the Duke of York and the Earl of Suffolk. The King, he says, is on his way
home, the prisoner-s had reached Dover, the Londoners had gone forth to Blsckheath
well armed that these foreigners might see what stout men the King hed left at home
{or the safeguard of the renim. Doubtleoe the arrival of Katherine of Franoe made the
ntndy of French fashionableg the name οἰ william Kyngesmylle, an Oxford pedagogus
who kept an “ ostelle'' in that University, is mentioned ; he may have been the author
of this portion ot the MS. ’

⁸ Bale, p. 723, gives amongst his numerous writings one entitled ‘⁸ De pronunciatione
Gallicae· beginning—“ Multi ao varii homines literati ;” this is repeated by Pits, p. 745.
