Angli· quo fulget, quo gandent presule clare

Firmo justicie misteria suscipe sacre,

In the margin is written ε “ Domino F. episcopo London. Magister ιῐ.
de Karlandia (sic) seipsum et opus suum de misteriis ecclesie? There
are interlinear gloeses as well as marginal comments by a later hand3 over
basis aurea in the third line is to be read “alludit nomini suo,” namely
Basset. This work is a my stical explanation in hexameter verse ofrites of the
clim-ch, vestments and appliances of sacred use, διο. The difference of opi-
nion among writers on mediaeval literature, as regards the time when John de
Garlandia lived and the country of which he was a native, has been already
noticed. The assertion of Pits, that he was born in Englaud, has been fol-
lowed by Fabricius, Moreri, and Du Gange3 and, although the dedication of
the poem which I have here noticed is doubtless insufficient evidence to prove
that the friend of a bishop of London was himself an Englishman, yet it
may suffice to show that the author was contemporary with a distinguished
prelate of that see named Fulke, and none so named is found earlier than
Fulke Basset, who was elected in 1241, and died in 1259.ιι It would thus
appear that John de Garlandia lived in the thirteenth century, which the
evidence previously notieed tends also to prove, and not in the early part

of the eleventh century, as stated by the Benedictines in the Histoire ,

Litteraire de la France.

8. Merarius. -In a volume of grammatical tracte mostly attributed
to «Iohannes de Garlandia, preserved in the Library at Caius college,
Cambridge, as already noticed, 1 find appended to the‘ ‘Dioeionoems

no ot ieed. Catalogue o! MSS. in Caius Collega Library, by the Rev. J . J. Smith, p. 17⁹.
A copy among Archbishop Parker's MSS. C.O.C. Cant. is described by Nasmyth, “ Carmen
ad Falconem Episcopum Londoniensem de Bitibus aeclesiasticum—us. 012. No. 4.

⁸ Μ. Gen-aud, Paris sous Philippo le Bel, Append. p. 583, adverte to this poem by John
de Gariandia, but he observes that it is not known who the bishop in question was, his

name being indicated only by the initial F. He is, however, identified by the glo- in
the MS. above described. The argument that the author was born in France, because
the name de ennodius, possibly from a place so called in Bru, is Frenoh rather than

English, dees not prove that he was not a native ef this country, or os a family established
in nugi-nd.
