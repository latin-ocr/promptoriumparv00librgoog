¹ It should wem that the cala, or swatan of the AngloeSaxons, were not compounded
with any bitter condiment, which was essential ιο the concoction of beer, s. drink of
Flemish οι· German origin. and until the XVIth cent. imported from the Continent, or
brewed by foreigners only in this country. The Promptorium gives namt, cervisia
beatutidine, as distinguished from ale, which wss not hopped ς Gsxton, in the Boke for
Travellers, speaking ot drinks, makes the distinction, ‘⁶ Ale ot* Englsnd, Byre of Ale-
mayne ς ” and it appears by the Customs of London, Amold’s chron. 87 . that beer was
first made in London by “ byere brewsrs. straungers—Flemyngis, Duehemen,'’ διο. s.
recipe foi· making single beer with mslt sud hops is given, p. 247. It bas been asserted
that the use of hope was forbidden by Hen. vl. in consequence of s petition of the Com-

mons. mentioned by Fuller, in his Worthies, under Essex, against ‘⁶ the wicked weed
called hops ;'’ but no record of the prohibition has been found, and the petition does not
appear on the Rolls ot Psrliament. In the time ol Heu. VIII. some prejudice seems to
have srisen regarding their use, for among the articles for the reform of sundry misuses
in the royal household‚ 1531, is sn injunction ιο the brewer not to put any hops or brim·
stone into the ale. Archaeol. iii. 157. Hops, called in Dutch Hoppe‚ Germ. Hopffen,
were introduced into England from Artois, between 10 and 15 Hen. VIII. as affirmed
in Stowe's Chron. about the time of the expedition against Tonrnsy. Bullein‚ in the
¹⁸ Bulvmrke of Defence,'' written about 1550, speaks of hops as growing in Suffolk. They
are mentioned in the stat. 5 and 6 Edw. v1. c. 5, 1552, ss cultivated in England3 Stat.
01 Realm‚ iii. 135. Among the privileges conceded to the strangers from the Low
Oountries, who settled at Stamford‚ 1572, is s clause regarding the free exercise of hus·
bandi-5, in which are specified hops, and all things necessary to gardens- Strype, Life of
Parker‚ App. 115. The management of hops was quickly scquired, ns appears by the
instructions given by Tumor, in March’s and J une’s humandi-5, published 1557.

“ certeyne Dutch practises,’' p. 85. edit. 1592. are detailed, and curicus; and he
appears to have been conversent with the method adopted in Flanders. The stst. 1
Jac. 1. c. 18, against the deterioration of hops, shows that n large quantity was still

supplied in 71603 from foreign parts. See Beckmsn's Hist. ot Iuventium, iv. 325, snd
