xlii PREFACE.

The edition by Richard Pynson in 1499 is one of the most scarce pro-
ductions of his press3 probably, as Dibdin observes, he may have reprinted
in subsequent years a volume which must have proved so extensively

’ acceptable3 no other impression of it, however, by that printer, who
industriously prosecuted his art until 1529, is known to exist. ΤΙιθ
volume is a small folio of 115 leaves; there is no title page, the first page
is blank, the prologus being on the reverse of the leaf. It commences
thus :—

“ ῚῘ Incipit prologus in libellum qui dicitur promptorius puerorum.

Cernentibus solicite clericorum condiciones,” . . . and concludes, . . .
“ pro me peccatore misericorditer intercedant dominum nostrum ihesum
christum,” etc.

“ ἹῘ Explicit prologus.”

Sign. a. ii. “ ῚῘ Incipit liber quidicitur Promptorium paruulorum siue
clericorum.”

The signatures a and b have eight leaves each, the rest, to t inclusive,
have only six. The book is printed in double columns; there are running
titles or headings of the pages, “ Nomina A—Verba A‚” and so forth,
throughout the alphabet‚ distinguishing nouus and other parts of speech from
the verbs, respectively. On sign. t iii. there is the following colophon :-

“ ἹῘ Ad laudem et ad honorem omnipotentis dei et intemerate genitricis
ejus. Finit excellentissimum opus exiguis magnisque scolasticis vtillissi·
mum. quod nuncupatur Medulla grammatice. Inpressum per egregium
Richardum pynson, in expensis virtuosorum virorum Fmdrici egmondt et
Petri post pascha. anno domini .M.CCCC. nonagesimo ncnc. Decima v·
die mensis Maii.''

In this colophon, here printed with the contracted words in extenso, two
points of interest claim attention3 the first is the change of title, the libellus,
described in the prologue as “ Promptorius puerorum ” being here called
“ Medulla grammatice3 ” the second is the mention of the patrous through
whose encouragement the costs of Pynson's undertaking were defrayed.
By similar notices in other books from his press we know that he received
the like favors from Margaret, mother of Henry VII., from the Earl of
Kent and other patrous of literature. Frederic Egmondt may have been
of an ancient race of the name in the Netherlands. Dibdin seems to have
assumed that ‘⁸ post pascha '’ was part of the date, whereas from the preci-
