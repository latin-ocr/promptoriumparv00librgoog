Another poem, ‘ De Mysteriis Ecclesiae,’ published entire by Otto,
commemorates the death of that ‘ Gemma pudicitiae . . . flos philosophias,
Aula decens morum, redolens velut area florum,' Alexander of Hales,
and is dedicated to Fulco Bishop of London. Now the irrefragable
doctor, as Johannes himself tells us, died in 1245, and Fulke Basset
retained his see, spite of the ⁸need and greed of King and Pope, from
1244 to 1259. Again, the triumph of the church which Johannes
commemoratos at greatest length is the Albigensian crusade (De Tri·
umphis Ecclesiae, iv. v. vi), and in his Dictionary he tells us that he
saw at Toulouse, among other enginee of war, that by which Simon de
Montfort was killed in 1218.” There can no longer, 1 apprehend, be any
question as regards the period to which we should assign an author, in
whose productione, trifling as their grammatical valae may be, the anti-
quar-y will still find, and more particularly in his Dictionarius, a large
amount of recondite information.
