appears that the jewelled work termed Anticum opus was, at the commencement of the
xlth cent. in high esteem even in Italy (Mutat. Seript. Ital. iv. 360 ε) and in the times
of Boniface VIII. about the year 1300, are mentioned “v. onufr-ipio, quorum iij.

Langley, Bp. Durham, who died 1437, were a vestment of crimson velvet, ‘⁴ casulo, ij.

vestmeuts of baudkyn, with “ orfrays de baudekyn rubeo, contexi’ cum cercis et avibus

been frequently separate, so as to be used at pleasure with the vestmeut of colour
suitable to the day. Inventories and wills afford innumerable evidences of the extra-
ordinary richness of these decoratione, and curious information as to the perfection to
which the arts were carried in Englaud at a remote period.

¹ The precise period when the use of the organ was introduced into Britain has not
been ascertained3 it is supposed to have been first used iu Frauce in 757. Compare
Anu. Fr. brevem· Anu. Francorum 3 and Eginh. Ann. Pepiui3 which concur in naming
that year as the date of the introduction. Eginhard also mentions the arrival in Franco
of a priest from Venice, who was able to construet organa. in 826; hut the instrument
does not appear to have been generally used in western Europe before the Xth cent.
At that period Elphegus, Bp. winchester, constructed an organ, the melodicus sounds
of which are highly commended in the verses of Wolstan. In the time of Edgar‚
St. Dunstan, who died 988, caused ‘⁸ oryana'’ to be constructed for the church of Glas·
tonbury, according to J oh. Glaston. ς and iu that of Malmcsbury, where he bestowed

bury Abbey. Numerous curious particulare are recorded respecting the use of organa
in Englaud, as at st. Alban’s‚ in Cott. MS. Nero, D. vn.; and Croylaud. where there
were ‘⁴ oryana solennia in introitu ecclesie superius situata.’' as well as smaller organs
in the choir. Portable instrumenta, called frequently regale, were much in use, aud
representations occur in many illuminatione and sculptures. A very curious repre-
sentation of the orgau exists iu Eadwine's Psalter, Triu. Coll. Camb. R. 17, i. and has
been copied iu Strntt's Horda‚ 1. pl. 33. Orgaus were imported from Flanders, as ap-

that the usual term, a pair of organs, has reference to the double bellows whereby con-
tinuous sound was produced3 or, according to Douce, to their being formed with a
double row of pipes. See O’Connor’s curious observations on the early use of organa
and psalmody in the Irish church, Hib. Script. iv. 153.
