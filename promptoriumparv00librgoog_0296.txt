Dietionary of John de Gan-landis, printed in the Collection of documents relating to
Freneh history, Paris, 1837, there is an enumeration of weepons and sngines ol war,
used st the siege of Toulouse, in 1218: the writer says that he saw “mm, bipennes,

1160, repeatedly describes the English in Herold’s army as armed with ehnrp gisa-mee
and hatchets. whereas their opponente fought with long lances and swords. See lin.
12‚908‚ 12,928, 13‚437. It may be observed, however, that on the Beyeux tepenti-5
the Saxone are represented ae eombating with the heavy axe, but no wespon appears
which resemblee the gisarme. In the Royal mandate, 36 Hen. 111.1262. printed by

alia arma minuta.” From this document, and the stat. Wint. 13 Edw. 1. c. 6, 1285,
it is apparent that the gisame was one os the weepons in ordinary use among the inferior
ranke ot the English army. See Stat. os Reslm. i. 97. A eurious description os the

Flodden‚ 1513; it was os two kinds, according to Sir S. Meyrick, namely, the glaive
gisarme, and the bill gisarme ς the distinctive mark os the weapon being a epike rising at

’Β The gnei-ne, getron, or ciuem, Fr. yuitms, was a stringed instrument, which
seems, from the repeated mention that is made os it by Chaucer. to heve been much in
flavour, probably as an accompaniment to the voice. In the [nt. Eng. vocabulary. Roy.
MS. 17 C. xvn. are given “fiya, getyrne: mator, getyrner.” t. 43‚b. Amongst

positive intemation on the obscure subject of the early history of music, it may hs
etsted, conjecturum, that the ffitorue is the instrument which was held in an horizontnl
position, and pleyed either by hand or with s plectrum, as may be seen in almost every
representation of the angelio cheir, whether in sculpture, painted glans, or illuminated
MSS. The minstrels' gallery on the North side of the nave et Exeter Cath.. sculptured
