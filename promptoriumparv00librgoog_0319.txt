‘⁰ ordeyned hym ful well

In the Avowynge of Kyng Arther, a ‘⁴ gunne ‘¹' is mentioned, the effect of which is com-
pared to lightning, but it is still doubtful whether the term should be understood to
imply a projectile impelled by any ignited substance, or merely filled therewith.

“There came fliand a gunne,
And lemet as the leuyn) ’⁹ St. 65, edit. by Mr. Robson.

It seems very probable that the missile here intended was a tube filled with Greek flre,
or seu volant. In several MSS. of the Praetica of John Arderne‚ a surgeon of eminence
&Edon 111. instructions are found for compounding· ‘seu-es Greyois' ’‘and ‘sewen volunta-'¹
the latter being a liquid mixture, described as of an oily nature. with which a pipe being
filled, and ignited by a match, would fly in any direction. A figure is given in the
margin. He proceeds to describe “sewe volant” of another kind. “ Per-nez j. ci. de
sousrs vif, de charbem-9 de saux, (i. weloghe,) ij. ἰὰ, de salpen-e, vj. li. si lessetez bien et

θαι pondre vault ὰ qetaere pelottes de fer, οιι de plom, οιι d'areyne, one vn, instrument qe
l'em appelle gonne.'' See Sloane MSS. 335. 795. A detailed account of passages in
ancient documenta or chronicles which throw light on this obscure subject has been
given by Sir S. Meyrick, in his Crit. Enquiry‚ and a paper on the history of hand iire-
arms‚ Archaeol. xxii.; and likewise by Mr. Archihald, in his description of ancient
artillery discovered on the coast of Lancasffire, Archaeol. xxviii. It may here suffice
to state that gnnpowder was known in Western Europe about the middle of the Xlllth
cent. 3 and that the earliest recorded instance of its use in war, in this country, appears
ιο have been iu the first expedition of Edward 111. against the Scots‚ in 1327, when
arffllery. termed by Barbour “ crakys of wer,'' was employed. See J amieson. There can
be no doubt that Chaucer uses the term ‘⁴ gonne,'' to signify an engine charged with

gunpowder3 as in the following compsi-ison:

‘⁴ Swift as a pellet out of a gonne,
When fire is in the ponder ronne.'' House of Fame, B. iii.

The Household of Edw. 111. as appears by the ordinances which commence 1344, printed
by the Ant. Soc„ comprised ⁰⁴ lngyners lvij. Artellers vj. Gonnens vj.'' Their daily pay in
time of war was δά. The invention of hand stre-arms is assigned by Sir S. Meyrick, on
the authority oi ninius, ιο the Lucquese, in 14303 (Archaeol. xxii. 60) yet a prior use of
some weapons ot* the sort seems to be indicated. In an Inventorv of the arms and effecta
of Sir Simon Burley. taken apparently after his execution, 1338, and now in the pooees-
sion of Sir Thomas Pliillipps, among‘ ‘petite-3 choses ὰ Baynard casteuss‘ is na ned ·j.

“quarell gunnesss 'at 7⁸. each5 for saltpetre, sulphur, and wadding, and the coutem-
porary evidence of Monstrelet shows that‘ ‘ba-stom ὰ feu” were among the arms ot the

purchases for the defence of Holy [sland. 14463 and were used at the siege of Caistor,
in Norfolk, about 1459. Paston Lett. iv. 316. In the version of Vegecius attributed to
Trevisa, and completed 1408, in the account of military engines‚ allusion is made to
‘⁴ grete gunnes that shete now a daiae stenes ot* so grete peyse that no walle may with·
