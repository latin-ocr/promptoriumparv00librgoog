Psrlisment, vol. ii. 160, thet early in that year (20 Edw. 111.) e petition had been pne-
sented by the Gemmeus, which set forth thet membsnts end others exported the good

beurunes, dont la livre poet estre achate par dela pur oyt mldz, οιι pur myns.” with which
the country was filled. The King's pleesure was thot such offenders should be Judged
according to lew, es ‘⁴ saux mamre? In the year following the Gemmeus again
petitioned “ pur σε qe la sauses menois de Lusshebourues suerat de jour en «πάνθ’ en evil

prsying for “plue aspre remedie-'⁹ Rolls of Perl. ii. 167. In 1351 these sulse sterlings
ere again mentioned in the petition thet declaration should be made by the King es to
whnt offences should be adjudged trema, of which one was the importstion of false coin,
‘⁴ sicone la menoie appelle Lusseburgbe‚” or other resembling the coin of the reslm. ss
fully declared in the stat. 25 Edw. 111. c. 2, where the word is written ‘⁶ Lueyuburgh.”
Compare Rolls of Perl. ii. 239, end Stat. of Beelm, i. 820. These fallacious menies ere

And yet loketh he lik a sterlyng,

In the Osnt. Tales, which, according to Tyrwhitt, were written subsequently to 1382,
allusion occurs to ‘⁸ Lusheburghes,'' es coins of base 211053 Monks Tele, v. 13,968: ss

It must be observed, that in Twysden's edition of Knngon, es likewise in the printed
text of the Bolls of Perliament, the term has been given es Lussheburne, apparently in
consequence of its origin having been forgotteng it seems, however, evident thet the true
reading should be Lussheburue, which is merely s varistion from Lussheburwe‚ or anyn·
burgh. See further on this subject Ruffing, i. 2223 Snelling's Plates of counterfeit
sterlings, and the matter fiir Miinzkunde, 1839. The import of the word Papira, in
relation to base coin is obscure. It is found in the winchester MS. only. The coins of
the Byzantina emperors, called perpuri, and the Italian paparini, were monies of con·
sidet-able velue. but there was e base coinage in Frnnce during the XIVth cent. of pisces
of bed slloy, called pai-pilloles. See Cherpentier.
