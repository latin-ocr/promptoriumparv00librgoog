5. J ohannes de Garlondia 111 diceionario scolasticO.—'I'he writings of this

author are of considerable interest ιο ι110 antiquary, however debased may
be the Latinity of his treatises, once among the best elementary auxiliaries
for the instruction of youth. It is not without reason that Erasmus th'us
bursts forth in contempt of the complicated sophistries of the Schools.
‘⁴ Deum immortalem! quale seculum erat hoc quum magno apparatu
disticha J oannis Garlandini adolescentibus operosis ao prolixis commen·
tariis enarrabantur.’' The curious information, however, preserved in
the Dawonmwus of John de Garlandia‚ sometimes called de Gallandia or
Gerlandus, may induce us to overlook the imperfect erudition of the
period. The work has been edited with care by Μ. Geraud in the “ Col-
lection de Documents inedits sur l'histoire de France,”¹’ and subsequently
by Mr. Thomas Wright in a valuable volume of Vocabularies edited by
him, and published at the expense of Mr. Joseph Mayer.⁸ It commences
thus, —‘ ‘Dictionarius dicitur libellus iste a dictionibus magis necessariis
quas tenetur quilibet scolaris,'’ dcc. The statements of writers on
mediseval authors and literature are contradictor-y in regard to the
period when John de Garlandia lived, and the country of which he was 8
native. M. Geraud came to the conclusion that he was born in France
in the eleventh century3 that he travelled across the seas, returned to
his native country, and there died ς he supposes that the Dicebam-ius was
compiled towards the year 1200. 111 this opinion my learned friend Andre
Pottier‚ 111 1113 notices of the MSS. in the Public Library at Rouen which
are under his care, was disposed to concur. There is a MS. of the Diction-
