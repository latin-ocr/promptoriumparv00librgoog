comment-exuent of the xvlth century the use of the Arabio numerals hed in some
degree superseded the ancient mode of calculating by the abacus 3 an'd eountern, which,
nt the period when the Promptorium wne compiled, were generally used. Herealter we
find the word coum-men nonna as an evidence. They were not indeed wholly dis-
ueed nt s. time long subsequent: nn allusion to enleuhtion by countere occurs in Shake·
speere, and later authors prove that they hed not been entirely dinem-ded. Algorithm
or algorism,n term univenally used in the xlvth und xvth centurion to denote the
oeienee of calculation by 9 figures and zero, is of Arabio derivation.
