pannon. Α xxix ·

in double columns, in a small neat hand os the thirteenth century, with
marginal explanations and interlinear glosses by a second scribe in paler
ink. It commences,-÷“ Commentarius liber iste curialium personarum et
rerum et vocabulorum preorditur,” and ends as follows, —-“ Hec edita sunt
pai-ysius sub venerabili cancellario parysius Galtero de castello Theodorici,
anno domini M⁰.cc⁰.40⁰. sexto gloriosum et admirabilem partum beate Marie
Virginis demonstrante.” If, as appears most probable, this tract, written
in the style and manner of the Dictionarius by John de Gariandia previously
noticed, can be recognised with certainty as from his pen, this colophon
and date at its close supply fresh and conclusive evidence in regard to the
disputed question of the period when he wrote, and agree perfectly with
the circumstances mentioned hereafter in regard to his work ‘⁶ de Myste-
riis eeclesie‚'’ and its dedication to Fulke, Bishop of London, in the first
half of the thirteenth century. The Commentarius Gum'alium seems well
deserving of being printed, as illustrative not only of language but of
manners and eustoms, and of soeial life at that period. The text is
moreover full of French words explanatory of Latin terms of which a
considerable portion are found scattered through the pages of the Promp-
torium.

7. Libellus misteriorum qui dicitur Anglia que fulget (quo fulget,
Prompt. Winch. MS.)—Among works attributed to John de Garlandia
a treatise is mentioned by Bale‚ p. 153, on the authority of Bostonus
Buriensis, entitled “ Mysteriorum Ecclesiae, lib. 1. Anqlia quo tendis tua
dum.” Pits, p. 184, gives the same line as the commencement of a
work with the title thus slightly varied, “ De mysteriis Ecclesiae:” he
mentions also a commentary upon it. Leyser includes it in his list of the
writings of Garlande.⁸ A copy of a metrical treatise with a similar title
but commencing “Anglia quo fulget,'' may be found in Cott. MS. Claudius
A. vul. f. 20412„ concluding thus, “Lucida terribulumyedolem campana
sonora ;’' and there is also a copy in a collection of grammatical tracts
chiefly by John de Garlandia in Caius College Library, Cambridge.b The
prefatory lines commence thus :—
