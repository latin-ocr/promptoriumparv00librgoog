APPnme. ” lvii

The text in this editio princeps varies considerably from that of the later
editions which I have seen. In some instanceS, errore of the prese seem to
have been corrected3 in othere, the earlier edition is more accurate than the
later, and a large number of hexameter lines illustrating the meaning of
Latin words, here introduced with the heading “ Versu3,” are not found in
subsequent edition83 these reprints do not appear in other respect-s to have
undergone any material abridgment.

The edition printed by Pynson in 1509, is not less rare than that of
1500 by W. de Worde. The following description has been taken from a
copy in the King's Library in the British Museum. It was in Herbert’s
collection in 1773. It is a small 4to. measuring '723 by 53 Sign. 3 iii.

never to have seen the editlon of 1500 (in perfect state), supposed that this book had
been printed by W. de Worde about the close of the fifteenth century, and that it
might be the editio princeps of the Ortus, ranging with Pyneon's folio Promptorium. In
