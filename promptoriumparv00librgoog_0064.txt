legible haud, on parchment and paper mixed3 imperfect. At the begin-
ning is the prologue, ‘⁴ Hec est regula,” as above3 at the end, ‘⁴ Explicit
Medulla Gramatice.” Late fifteenth century.

5. Harl. MS. 2181. Another copy in abridged form, carelesaly written
on parchment3 late fifteenth century.

6. Harl. MS. 2257. A neatly written MS. The text seems to resemble
that of the Ortus Vocabulorum, but it contains much that is not found in
that book, nor in the Medulla in its ordinary form3 possibly an abridge-
ment of this dictionary. This is perhaps the most valuable MS. of its kind
in the British Museum‚ but it is unfortunately imperfect. It commences
with the word “ Boletus est genus fungi,” and ends with ‘⁴ Zona.”

7. Harl. MS. 2270. Attributed in Catal. Harl. MSS. vol. ii. p. 635,
to Galfridus Grammaticus, and on the first leaf is written, but not by
a contemporary hand,—“ Medulla Grammaticoe Galfridi.” On paper;
beginning ‘⁴ Hec est regula generali8‚‘’ dcc. The first word in the dic-
tionary is “ Alma ;” the last is ‘⁴ Zozimus . . . Explicit Medulla Gramatice
Noviter.”

8. Harl. MS. 6514. Imperfect3 the explanatione in Latin are given
more fully than ιιι some other copies.

9. Add MS. in Brit. Mus. 24, 640. This copy, in small folio, written on
parchment, is unfortunately imperfect at the beginning and the end.- It
is otherwise ιιι fine condition, written ιιι a neat legible hand3 probably not
much later than the middle of the fifteenth century. There are plain
rubricated initial letters3 and some marginal additions occur which seem to
be by a nearly contemporary hand. It begins with the word “ Abhomina-
rium,” and the concluding word is “ Hec mantica, a male.” It was
purchased from Mr. J. O. Halliwell in May, 1862, and, as stated in a
note written by his hand, it had been presented to him by Mr. Hunt of

Stratford-on-Avon.¹’
