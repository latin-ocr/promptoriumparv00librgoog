PREFACE. ⁴ xv

predicatorem reclusum Lenne Episcopi,” had sought a retreat from more
active duties to devote his leisure to the task which he had undertaken.
If the library of his own house could not supply him with the work·
necessary for his literary purpose, doubtless they. could have been easily
obtained from those of other houses belonging to the Order.

There is no reason to suppose that the word reclusus is here used in
any other than its strict sense of an “ ankyr,” one who was shut up in a
building specially appropriated to the purpose, and with a solemn service,
by episcopal sanction3 aster which he could not leave his cell except in
case of necessity or with the permission of the bishop.⁸ The expression in
the preface, ‘⁴ Lenne sub regula paupertatis astrictus,’' probably refers to
the vows taken on the occasion of his becoming a Dominican friar. The
author has himself explained the word “ ankyr ” by' “ reoluse,'' and ren-
dered it anachorita (p. 12). An instance of a friar being a recluse (indum)
at Pagham in Sussex is mentioned in the will of St. Richard, Bishop os
chichester* and we read of an anchoress within the nunnery of Clemen-
thorpe, near York, in 1475.θ “

The author was, as we learn from his own words, bred, if not born, in
Norfolk: “ comitatus N orthfolchie modum loquendi solum sum secutae,
quem solum ab infancia didici, et solotenus plenius perfectiusque cognovi.”
It may deserve observation that the peculiarities os the local dialect os
the county should have been thus distinctly noticed at this period. We
are, however, informed that, at an earlier time, Samson de Botington,
abbot of St. Edmundsbury 1182-1211, was aecustomed to discourse
to the people in the vernacular of Norfolk, the county in which he was
born and bred, and that he had a pulpit for the purpose in the conventual
church.‘¹

is stated to have been “ frater Ricardus Fraunoes, inter quatuor parietes pro Christo
inelums.” Ames has inserted a note by a ΜΓ. Lewis, who was led to the conclusion that
he had actually been starved to death between tour νεὼς but Herbert observes that
the phrase means no more than that he was confined or imprisoned; to which Dibdin
adds ‘⁴ most probably a voluntary recluso or monk.’' Typ. Ant. vol. ii. p. 418.
