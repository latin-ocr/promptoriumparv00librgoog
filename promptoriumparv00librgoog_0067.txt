Grammatice last described, but with considerable modifications and addi-
tions from other sources. Although comparatively of more frequent occur-
rence than the Ptomptorium, it is a book of great rarity. The earliest
edition hitherto noticed is that printed in 1500 by Wynkyn de Worde in
small folio, ranging with the editio princeps of the Promptorium issued
from the press of Pynson in the previous year. It is indeed probable that
it may have been intended to supply an accompaniment to that Dictionary.
This rare editio princeps of the Ortus has not been carefully described3
the imperfect mention by Dibdin would lead us to suppose that, having
never examined a copy, he had relied on the brief notice hy Herbert
chiefly derived from the Harleian catalogue, in which two copies are
enumerated, Nos. 5213, 5304; Ι have been unable to ascertain where
these may now be found.⁸ There is, however, a copy of this first edition
among the bookS, chiefly MSS„ bequeathed by Junius to the Bodleian3 it
is thus described in Tanner's Catalogue of that precious lexicographieal
collection.-—“ Hortus Vocabulorum, Impr. Lond. 1500, per Wynkyn de
Worde, intersparsis Ol. Junii notis.’' OEtal. MSS. Angliae, t. i. p. 251.
The following description has been taken from a fine copy of this edition
in the British Museum, in the Grenville Library.

Fo. 1 rect0.-“ *J Ortus, Vocabulorum ''--the lower portion of the page
