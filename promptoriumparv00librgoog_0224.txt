indicate that it was originally written dywere‚ or divere, which may be derived from tho
old Freneh, “ divers, inconstans, bizas-re, incommodel’ nouum. It occurs, however,
written as above, in a poem by Humphrey Bremton, who lived in the reign of Hen. vn.
which bas been pn‘nted under the title of ‘⁴ the most pleasant song of Lady Bessy,
eldest daughter of King Edw. ΠΡ

‘⁴ That time yon promised my father dear,
'l'o him to be both true andjnst,
And now you stand iu a disweare‚

following explanation of Par-apsis, ‘⁴ proprie est discus sive vas quadr-amyntam, ea:
omni parte lca-bens latera aqualia, a dobulerfl The term is derived from the Freneh
danblin, a dish ς it occurs in Piers ploughman, and is still retained in the cumberland
and Nol-thern dialeets. See Ray and Brockett.

² It appears that the compilor of the Promptorium assigned to baltheum, which pro-
perly signifles the cingulum militare, the unusual meaning of a gai-ment of defenoe.
'rbus corr. suune previously is rendered bacchus. The Catholioon explains “ai-
plot‘s. duplex vestis, et eet vestis militaris,¹‘ bnt it does not appear to have been ori-
ginally, as it subsequently became on the disuse of the gambeson, a gai-ment of defenoe.
The dubledus mentioned in the Constitutions of Fred. 11. King of Sicily, in the xlvth
century, was a gai-ment of ordinary use by nobles and knights, as were also. it is pro·
bable, the rich gan-ments provided for John 11. of Franee, in 1852. when Stephon de
Fontaine‚ his goldsmith, accounts for the delivery of “ nmfin drap d'or de domm, a un
fin camoena d'outremoe, pour faire deux doubcesfl At this period wadded defenoes
were made in Paris by the amm-im, and the tsilors were divided into two erasts,
poavpointim and doubletiers ,· it was only in 1358 that the Regent Gharles, on aeoount
of the nse ot the doublet beooming general, permitted the tailors to exercise also the
ers-st os doubletiers. See the Reglemens sur les Metiers, edited by Depping, p. 414.
shortly after, however, the doublet appears as a military defeneeg ‘⁴ 25 doubletteffi 24
jakkes,'‘ and other armours, are enumerated among the munitione οἱ Hadlegh Castle
granted in 1406 by Hem-y lv. to bis son Humfrey. Rymer, viii. 384. The importanoe

eoneeeded in 140⁷ to the ‘⁶ arram-ariis linearum maturarum civitatis Loudonie.¹'
