(12.) “ Liber Equivocorum vocabulorum,” by John de Gal-landis.—
Amongst grammatical treatises by this author, of whom some account 1188
been given pp. xxvi—xxxii. supra, this and the “ Synonyma ” claim no·-
tice on account of the English words occurring in the commentary or
“ expositio,” attributed to the author of the Promptorium. There 810
’ numerous MSS. of both works, of which 8180 several editions were printed
by Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson3 See Herbert, and Dibdin, Typ- Ant.
vol. ii. pp. 96, 406. 1 have consulted chiefly the edition by W. de Worde,
Lond. 1499. As a specimen of the work and of the accompanying eatpo-
st'tio by Galfridu8‚ the· learned 10011180 of Lynn, 1 may cite the following
curious passage :—

⁶⁴ Fungus boletus et fungus dicitur 8108.

“ Ἴ Η10 docet autor quod fungus habet duas significationes. Nam fun-
gus id est boletus: anglice paddokstole. Vel 081 quedam avis anglice an
ostrich: quia ut aliqui dicunt est illa qui comedit sermm .i. ferreos claves:
anglice horsenayles. ἹῘ Fungus dicitur a fungor, fungeriS, secundum
vocem : sed 8 defungor, defungeriS, secundum significationem, defungor
id est mori, quia comedentes fungoS, sicut plures faciunt in partibus trans-
marinis, sepius moriuntur. Unde Marcialis cocus,—

Defunctos fungis hominis materne negabis,
Boleti leti 081188 fuere tui.”

(13). “ Synonyma,” by John de Gariandia.-This work, formerly, as
was also that last mentioned, in high esteem for instruction of scholare,

has been already noticed. See p. xvii , supra. I have made use chiefly
of the edition by W. de Worde, 1500, ‘⁶ cum expositione magistri Gal-
fridi Anglici,’' namely, the author of the Promptorium, whose commentary

Hereford 8011001, about 1373; Sloane MS. 6. A version printed by Robert Wyer‚
without date, describes thia Herbal 88 “ praetys'd by Doctor Lynaorff 800 Δωο8’8 Typ.
Ant. p. 158.

⁸ It may deservo notice that the “ Poetria nova‚'' ascribed by Pita to Gali'ridua Gram-
maticus, as stated p. xviii. supra, but probably written by Galfridue Vineaauf, as Biahop
Tanner observes, 8001118 to have been regarded at thia time 88 a 111-0111101108 of the former.
Under the word “ 88831118 ” is the explanation—‘⁴ 081 idem quod progenies. Unde Gal·
fridus in Booti-ia, 811101· iatius libri,—Egregins 88031118 te confert Bartholomei.'' If this
passage, however, may be taken 88 referring to the Friar of Lynn, it ia obvious that we
must ascribe it to 801110 later commentator, by whom additions were made to 1118 expositio.
