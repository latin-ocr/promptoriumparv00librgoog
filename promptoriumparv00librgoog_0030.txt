rium5 they vary in their contente in a remarkable degree3 it might indeed
seem that each transcribet made such modificatione of the text as pleased
him, or that he engrafted upon it the additional words and explanatory
glosses which he found inserted by any previous hand. The text also
varies greatly from that of the Ortus printed by Wynkyn de Worde, a
work of considerable rarity, in the compilation of which materiale were
undoubtedly derived sargely from the Medulla, but with certain additions
from other sourceS, such as the Breviloquus‚ the Cornucopia, probably
the dictionary by N icolae Perotti so entitled, and the Gemma Vocabulorum.
It is difficult to account for the great variatione to be noticed in MSS. of
the Medulla and in the early Latin-English Dictionaries which Ι believe
to be substantially the same as that work. N one of those known to me
can be assigned to an earlier date than the latter half os the fisteenth cen·
tury. As an illustration of this remarkable want os conformity, I may
offer the renderings of “ Gintflo,” a remdable word which will be found
in the Promptorium as the rendering of ‘⁴ Askysye ’⁹ or askefise; p. 15,
abst-a! The principal variatione which Ι have found are as follows :—

“ Omitto, a syre blower, a yrene beter” (sic). (Harl. MS. 1,000.) “A
seyre blowere.’‘ (Harl. MS. 2181.) “A aske bathe, e. qui sedet iu cine-
ribus, et calefactor ferri? (Harl. MS. 2370.) “A fire blower, and a
heter of blode iren, or a axe wadelle.’‘ (Harl. MS. 2357.) “An askfist
or iren heter.” (Add. MS. 24,640.) “Askebawe, qui s. sedet in cineribus,
et calefactor ferri.” (Canterbury·MS.) “An aske fyse or irne eter.”
(MS. coll. Phillipps, 8344.) “A fyyre blowere, an yryn hetere, an
askefyce.” (MS. ibid. No. 8‚306.) ‘⁸ Qui flat in cinere, vel qui preparat
pulverem muliebrem, angl’ aske fyste a fyre blawer or a yrne hotter.”

enlarged by some other hand &om the works above enumerated‚ before its issue from the
prees of Wynkyn de Worde, in 1600.

⁸ The reading in Harl. MS. 221 is Askysye or Askesye‚ but possibly the word may
be more eorrectly Askeflse3 it was a term of reproach among the Nor-thern natione,
denoting an unwarlike tellow who stayed at home in the ‹mimirey-corner like a cat
among the ashes. See Ihm, Lexic. Suio-Goth. v. Aska, and the Saga of Rois, how the
Askefls won the King’s daughter to wife. A corresponding French word is given by
Hollyband, ‘⁴ Gauda—ier, he that keepeth the chimney-corner‚ a sluggard,” rendered
likewise by cotgrave ‘⁸ a sluggard, slowbacke, idlesbie, house dove, one that sits lurking
in the chimney corner.” The word may be preserved, as Ι am infor-med, in the name of a
house in Lincolnshire‚ Askefye Hall, near Spalding, once the abode of Maurice Johnson, -
bnt now usually written ‘⁶ Ayscough Fee Haun’
