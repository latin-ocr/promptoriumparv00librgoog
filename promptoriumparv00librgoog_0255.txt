² “ Fenelle, or fenkelle‚ seniculum, marahum.” cam. mo. The numerous virtues
01· thiu herb are thus summed up in the King'e coll. MS. of the Promptorium :

‘⁰ Bis duo dat marato-um, febres fugat atque venenum,
Et pumat nemaeum, sic reddit lumen acutum.”

Macer gives a detailed account. in which the following remarkable passages occur:
“ be edderee wole ete fenel, when her yen dasnyb, and eo she getii> a-yene her clere
aighteg and ber boroghe it ia founde and preved bat fenel dol> profit to mannis yene:
be yeu bat ben dueked, aud danii), ehul be anoyuted wit be ius of fenelle rotis medeled
wit hony3 and bis oynement ahalle put a-way alle be dasewenesse of hem, and make
hem bry3t.” The virtue of fenuel, in reatoring youth, was a dlecovery attributed
likewise by Macer to serpente ; “bis prouib aucteurs and filisoleria, for serpentia whan
men (sic) olde‚ aud willeth to wexe atronge, myghty, and yongly a-yeau‚ bei gon and
eteu oste renel, and bei become yongliehe and myghty.'' MS. in the possession ol H. W.
Diamond, Eeq. Fnflssrttss ia obviously a corruption of the Latin name; this herb is
still called in German Feneliel, and in Dutch Venckel. In Piera ploughman·s Vision
mention oecura of

“ A fei-thing worth of {ynkehsede {or {astynge duioe.’'
